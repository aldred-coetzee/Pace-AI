## 1. ACWR (Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio)

### 1.1 ACWR 0.8–1.3 = Optimal ("Sweet Spot")

- **Gabbett, T. J.** (2016). "The training-injury prevention paradox: should athletes be training smarter and harder?" *British Journal of Sports Medicine*, 50(5), 273–280.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2015-095788
  - Foundational paper establishing the 0.8–1.3 range.

### 1.2 ACWR >1.5 = High Injury Risk

- **Hulin, B. T., Gabbett, T. J., Blanch, P., Chapman, P., Bailey, D., & Orchard, J. W.** (2014). "Spikes in acute workload are associated with increased injury risk in elite cricket fast bowlers." *British Journal of Sports Medicine*, 48(8), 708–712.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2013-092524

- **Hulin, B. T., Gabbett, T. J., Lawson, D. W., Caputi, P., & Sampson, J. A.** (2016). "The acute:chronic workload ratio predicts injury: high chronic workload may decrease injury risk in elite rugby league players." *British Journal of Sports Medicine*, 50(4), 231–236.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2015-094817
  - Very-high ACWR ≥2.11 = greatest risk; ACWR ≥1.54 + high chronic load = 28.6% injury risk.

### 1.3 ACWR <0.8 = Undertraining Risk

- Implicit in the Gabbett/Hulin papers above. The specific <0.8 threshold is more convention than rigorously validated — low chronic workload reduces tissue resilience, making athletes vulnerable to subsequent load spikes.

### 1.4 Uncoupled vs. Coupled Calculation

- **Gabbett, T. J. et al.** (2019). "To Couple or not to Couple? For Acute:Chronic Workload Ratios and Injury Risk, Does it Really Matter?" *International Journal of Sports Medicine*, 40(10).
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1055/a-0955-5589
  - Both methods yield equivalent injury predictions (R²=0.99).

- **Windt, J., & Gabbett, T. J.** (2019). "Is it all for naught? What does mathematical coupling mean for acute:chronic workload ratios?" *British Journal of Sports Medicine*, 53(16), 988–990.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2017-098925

### 1.5 Caveats & Criticisms

- **Impellizzeri, F. M. et al.** (2020). "Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio: Conceptual Issues and Fundamental Pitfalls." *International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance*, 15(6), 907–913.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0864
  - Challenges causal validity; questions arbitrary time windows; notes inconsistent relationship across studies.

- **Bourdon, P. C. et al.** (2021). "Editorial: Acute: Chronic Workload Ratio: Is There Scientific Evidence?" *Frontiers in Physiology*, 12, 669687.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.669687

- **Qin, W., Li, R., & Chen, L.** (2025). "Acute to chronic workload ratio (ACWR) for predicting sports injury risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis." *BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation*, 17(1), 285.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13102-025-01332-x
  - Meta-analysis of 22 studies: ACWR is associated with injury risk but should be used with caution.

**Note for our system**: Most ACWR validation is from team sports (rugby, cricket). Application to distance running requires inference, though the underlying physiology (load vs. recovery) is universal. ACWR should be one data point among many, not a standalone predictor.

### 1.6 CV >0.3 Threshold for "Erratic Loading"

**No peer-reviewed source found.** The 0.3 (30%) threshold appears to be borrowed from general statistics convention (CV >0.3 = "high variability"). No sports science paper specifically validates this threshold for training load variability. Our injury risk prompt uses soft language ("worth investigating") which is appropriate given the lack of evidence. We should not use this as a hard pass/fail criterion in rubrics.

---

## 2. The 10% Rule (Weekly Progression)

### 2.1 Evidence Status: Guideline, Not Hard Rule

The 10% rule is widely cited in coaching but has limited direct scientific validation. Its exact origin is unclear.

- **Nielsen, R. Ø. et al.** (2014). "Excessive Progression in Weekly Running Distance and Risk of Running-Related Injuries." *Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy*, 44(10), 739–747.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.2519/jospt.2014.5164
  - 874 novice runners: >30% weekly increase = significantly higher injury rates. Non-injured runners averaged 22.1% increases — double the "rule."

- **Gabbett, T. J.** (2018). "Debunking the myths about training load, injury and performance." *British Journal of Sports Medicine*, 54(1), 58–66.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-099784
  - "The 10% rule is, at best, a 'guideline' rather than a 'code'."
  - Injury risk increases from 7.5% to 21% when progression jumps from <10% to >15%.

**Note for our system**: We use 10% as a guideline in rubrics. The evidence supports that >30% is clearly dangerous, 10-30% is variable by individual, and context (chronic load, training history, age) matters more than any fixed threshold.

## 3. Polarized Training (80/20)

### 3.1 The 80/20 Principle

The 80/20 split refers to **cumulative training TIME in intensity zones**, not sessions or distance.

- **Seiler, S., & Kjerland, G. Ø.** (2006). "Quantifying training intensity distribution in elite endurance athletes." *Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports*, 16(1), 49–56.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2004.00418.x
  - First comprehensive quantification: ~80% of training time at low intensity.

- **Seiler, S.** (2010). "What is best practice for training intensity and duration distribution in endurance athletes?" *International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance*, 5(3), 276–291.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.5.3.276
  - Core review establishing 80% low-intensity / 20% high-intensity time distribution.

- **Stöggl, T., & Sperlich, B.** (2014). "Polarized training has greater impact on key endurance variables than threshold, high intensity, or high volume training." *Frontiers in Physiology*, 5, 33.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2014.00033
  - Meta-analysis: polarized > threshold training for VO2max and endurance gains.

### 3.2 Resolving the 50-60% vs 80% Contradiction

These are **not contradictory** — they measure different things:

- **80/20** = intensity distribution = 80% of cumulative **training time** in Zone 1
- **50-60%** = volume distribution = what % of weekly **distance** comes from dedicated easy runs (excluding warm-up/cool-down segments of quality sessions)

Example: A 100 km/week runner might run 60 km in pure easy sessions (60% volume), plus 15 km of warm-up/cool-down within quality sessions. Total time in Zone 1 = ~80%.

**Action**: Our methodology should clarify this distinction and use 80/20 as the primary metric (time-based).

## 4. RED-S (Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport)

### 4.1 IOC Consensus Statements

RED-S replaced the "Female Athlete Triad" concept. It applies to **ALL genders**.

- **Mountjoy, M. et al.** (2014). "The IOC consensus statement: beyond the Female Athlete Triad — Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)." *British Journal of Sports Medicine*, 48(7), 491–497.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2014-093502
  - Landmark paper replacing the Triad with RED-S; explicitly notes male athletes are affected.

- **Mountjoy, M. et al.** (2018). "IOC consensus statement on relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S): 2018 update." *British Journal of Sports Medicine*, 52(11), 687–697.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-099193
  - Expanded guidance on male athletes, carbohydrate availability, mental health.

- **Mountjoy, M. et al.** (2023). "2023 International Olympic Committee's (IOC) consensus statement on Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (REDs)." *British Journal of Sports Medicine*, 57(17), 1073–1097.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2023-106994
  - Latest update; extends to Para athletes; emphasises both sexes affected equally.

**Note for our system**: RED-S criteria should not be limited to female athletes. However, female-specific concerns (menstrual health, iron deficiency) remain important additional screening items.

### 4.2 Iron Deficiency in Female Runners

- **Sims, S. T. et al.** (2022). "High Prevalence of Iron Deficiency Exhibited in Internationally Competitive, Non-Professional Female Endurance Athletes." *International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health*, 19(24), 16606.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192416606

### 4.3 Menstrual Health Screening

- **Melin, A. et al.** (2014). "The LEAF questionnaire: a screening tool for the identification of female athletes at risk for the female athlete triad." *British Journal of Sports Medicine*, 48(7), 540–545.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2013-093240
  - Validated screening tool (78% sensitivity, 90% specificity); recommended in IOC's REDs CAT2.

## 5. Youth/Teen Athlete Development

### 5.1 Training Intensity Limits

- **Casado, A. et al.** (2022). "Training Periodization, Methods, Intensity Distribution, and Volume in Highly Trained and Elite Distance Runners: A Systematic Review." *International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance*, 17(6), 820–833.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2021-0435
  - For ages 14+: max 5 running days/week, sessions ≤90 min, emphasis on aerobic development.

### 5.2 LTAD (Long-Term Athlete Development)

- **Varghese, M. et al.** (2021). "Youth Athlete Development Models: A Narrative Review." *Sports Health*, 14(1), 20–29.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/19417381211055396
  - LTAD provides a useful framework but has limited empirical support for age-specific prescriptions. The "windows of opportunity" concept lacks strong evidence.

### 5.3 Sleep Recommendations

- **Coel, R. A. et al.** (2022). "Sleep and the Young Athlete." *Sports Health*, 15(4), 537–546.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/19417381221108732
  - 8–10 hours/night recommended. Athletes sleeping <8 hours are 1.7x more likely to be injured.

### 5.4 Rest Days

Multiple professional organisations (AAP, NATA) recommend minimum 2 days/week off from organised training. Light activity on recovery days is acceptable. Additionally: 2–3 non-consecutive months annually off from any single sport.

## 6. VDOT, Daniels' Running Formula & Riegel

### 6.1 VDOT System

- **Daniels, J.** (2021). *Daniels' Running Formula*, 4th Edition. Human Kinetics.
  - ISBN: 9781718203662
  - The authoritative resource on VDOT. The system originated from 1970s work by Daniels and Jimmy Gilbert (NASA scientist). VDOT is widely used in coaching but the original derivation was not published in a peer-reviewed journal.

**Note for our system**: VDOT is an industry-standard coaching tool but lacks formal peer-reviewed validation of the specific zone calculations. We should cite the book and acknowledge this.

### 6.2 Riegel Race Prediction Formula

- **Riegel, P.** (1977). "Time Predicting." *Runner's World* magazine.
  - Formula: T₂ = T₁ × (D₂/D₁)^1.06
  - Popular article, not peer-reviewed. Widely adopted but no formal academic validation.

## 7. Taper Guidelines

### 7.1 Taper Meta-Analysis (Gold Standard)

- **Bosquet, L., Montpetit, J., Arvisais, D., & Mujika, I.** (2007). "Effects of Tapering on Performance: A Meta-Analysis." *Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise*, 39(8), 1358–1365.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0b013e31806010e0
  - 27 studies, 182 candidates. Optimal: 2-week progressive taper, 41-60% volume reduction, maintain intensity and frequency. ~3% performance improvement.

### 7.2 Recreational Marathon Taper

- **Smyth, B., & Lawlor, A.** (2021). "Longer Disciplined Tapers Improve Marathon Performance for Recreational Runners." *Frontiers in Sports and Active Living*.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.735220
  - 158,000+ runners. 3-week taper = 2.6% improvement (median 5:32 saving).

### 7.3 Taper by Distance (Coaching Consensus)

| Distance | Duration | Volume Reduction |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| 5K | 7–10 days | 25–30% |
| 10K | 5–7 days | 35–45% |
| Half Marathon | 2–3 weeks | 25–60% progressive |
| Marathon | 2–3 weeks | 41–60% progressive |

## 8. Senior/Masters Runner Physiology

### 8.1 VO2max Decline with Age

- **Rogers, M. A. et al.** (1990). "Decline in VO2max with Aging in Master Athletes and Sedentary Men." *Journal of Applied Physiology*, 68(5), 2195–2199.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1152/jappl.1990.68.5.2195
  - Continued training cuts decline to 5.5%/decade (vs 12% sedentary).

- **Zampieri et al.** (2022). "The Impact of Training on the Loss of Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Aging Masters Endurance Athletes." *International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health*, 19(17), 11050.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191711050
  - Training volume is critical: <10% volume reduction = 5-6.5% VO2max decline/decade.

### 8.2 Recovery & Training Modifications

Coaching consensus (not single landmark study): Masters runners (55-65+) benefit from:
- 10-day training cycles rather than 7-day
- 3–4 running days/week (vs 5–6 for younger athletes)
- 48–72 hour recovery between quality sessions (vs 24 hours)
- Strength training 2x/week (higher priority than for younger runners)
