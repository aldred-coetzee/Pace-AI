## The 40 Questions Coaching Platforms Answer

### CATEGORY 1: Training Pace & Zones
*Data required: Recent race time or time trial, max HR or LTHR, age*
*Models: VDOT, McMillan, Daniels/Gilbert, Karvonen HR formula*

**Q1. What should my easy/recovery pace be?**
- Input: Recent race result (5K-marathon), resting HR, max HR
- Analysis: VDOT lookup -> Easy pace zone; HR Zone 1-2 (59-74% max HR)
- Why valuable: #1 mistake runners make is running easy days too fast. Coaches say 80% of volume should be easy.
- Platforms: VDOT, McMillan, Runna, Garmin Coach, every coaching app

**Q2. What are my optimal training paces for each workout type?**
- Input: Recent race result (ideally 4-6 weeks old, all-out effort)
- Analysis: VDOT or McMillan calculator -> 5 zones: Easy, Marathon, Threshold, Interval, Repetition
- Why valuable: Running at wrong intensities = wrong physiological adaptations
- Platforms: VDOT ($), McMillan (free), TrainingPeaks ($), Runna ($)

**Q3. Should I train by pace or heart rate (or both)?**
- Input: HR data from runs, pace data, environmental conditions
- Analysis: Compare HR drift on easy runs, check if pace-based zones match HR-based zones
- Why valuable: Heat, altitude, fatigue, and cardiac drift all affect the pace-HR relationship
- Platforms: Garmin Coach, TrainingPeaks, Runna

**Q4. What heart rate zones should I use?**
- Input: Max HR (field test or lab), resting HR, lactate threshold HR
- Analysis: Friel 7-zone, Karvonen 5-zone, or Daniels 5-zone model
- Why valuable: Zone miscalibration leads to training at wrong intensities
- Platforms: TrainingPeaks ($), Garmin, Polar, WHOOP

**Q5. Are my training paces still correct, or have I improved?**
- Input: Recent race or time trial result, training log showing pace/HR trends
- Analysis: Recalculate VDOT; compare current easy pace HR to historical; track pace at same HR over time
- Why valuable: Training at stale paces = undertraining or overtraining
- Platforms: VDOT (recalculate every 4-8 weeks), Runna (auto-adapts), Garmin Coach (adapts)

### CATEGORY 2: Race Prediction & Goal Setting
