Here are the key insights:\n\n## Strava's Limitations for Running Training\n\n### Segment Chasing Can Hurt Training\nWith Strava Segments peppered across every ride or run, it's easy to get carried away. If you frequently hit Strava segments hard multiple times per week, it leads to diminishing returns. The fatigue you accumulate will eventually prevent you from effectively reaching the intensity you need to optimize fitness gains. You end up training neither hard enough nor easy enough. That middle ground limits adaptation.\n\n### Heart Rate Zones Are Limited\nStrava only has one HR profile. If you are a triathlete, you must choose to use your running HR zones or your cycling HR zones. For serious training, you need other parties like TrainingPeaks that does both.\n\n### Strava's New \"Instant Workouts\" Feature Has Issues\nThe instructions in Strava's new workout feature are \"a bit wonky,\" and it appears Strava confused seconds with meters in one workout.\n\n### Easy Runs Deserve More Attention\nIt's a topic of debate whether it matters if you're taking stops mid-run on easy days, and surprisingly, there's very little research on it. The advice is that on an easy run, it's always better to walk than stop. And if you feel the need to stop on an easy run, you probably need to slow down.\n\n### What Data Alone Doesn't Capture\nStrength and conditioning are key to getting the body performing well and remaining injury-free. It takes long for the body to adapt into a position where running can be completely injury-free. That's why strength training is crucial. As runners, we often love just running and neglecting things like strength, but it's an important ingredient to training.\n\n### Structured Training Matters More Than Data\nTo optimize the use of Strava for training, take advantage of the gamification aspect infrequently. Let your structured training plan dictate when you chase Segment stats, otherwise stick to the plan and enjoy the ride.\n\n### Training Plans Have Moved Off Strava\nEffective July 10th, athletes can no longer create new running training plans on the Strava website. These plans are now powered by Runna.\n\nIn essence, while Strava is excellent for tracking, motivation, and community, it doesn't replace a structured training plan, doesn't account for strength training or recovery, and its gamification features can actually undermine good training if overused.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"778eeae0-b215-4f96-9e53-d229f36124a9","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:17:04.807Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"d3291382-b678-4fb5-bc59-464c5c4da340"}

There's a request for the ability to combine activity types to get accurate readings by year and all-time.\n\n2. **Tracking Non-Run Activities on Foot**: One feature that Strava removed that users miss is the ability to track distance and elevation when doing an activity on foot that is NOT a run.\n\n3. **Disable Suggested Goals**: Users are asking if it's possible to disable everything goal-related, calling it \"incessant\" and saying they pay for an app to record activities, not for \"screen wasting goal suggesting and constant artificial validation.\" Users want the ability to opt out or disable these features.\n\n4. **Searchable Saved Routes**: Users request that saved routes be searchable on the phone app, with some having hundreds of routes saved by title.\n\n5. **Apple Health Sync Issues**: A Strava update removed the ability to have activities sync from third-party devices (like Garmin, Zwift) to Apple Health, causing widespread frustration on Reddit.\n\n### Strava's New \"Instant Workouts\" Feature\n\nStrava launched a new \"Instant Workouts\" feature, leveraging their acquisition of Runna, which gives subscribers a weekly set of five workouts in four categories, along with automatically suggested routes. However, critics think the feature could be a game-changer long-term but that it should have launched with \"push workout to device\" included, and that the workouts and wording don't make sense. Strava said in a Reddit post that pushing workout integration to Garmin & Apple devices is upcoming soon.\n\n### How Strava Handles Feature Suggestions\n\nStrava describes itself as a global community with millions of members and welcomes ideas and feature suggestions, but notes that it is not feasible to implement every idea received. Popular ideas that get lots of votes are regularly surfaced to Strava's Product Teams for review, but the number of votes is only one factor considered in planning their roadmap.\n\nNote: The original `site:reddit.com` search didn't return direct Reddit results, but these results capture the key Strava feature request discussions from both the Strava Community Hub and coverage of Reddit discussions.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"fc774d3f-ab5b-49d8-a74d-d162b3949199","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:17:06.593Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"60749ad4-1fac-4d96-9f01-763c3a53f35a"}

The search returned a mix of direct Reddit content, Strava community posts, and news articles about Strava-related Reddit discussions. Here's a summary of what I found:\n\n## Key Themes from Reddit/Community Discussions About Strava Wishes\n\n### Feature Requests\n- Users wish they could track both running shoes and custom insoles as separate gear for mileage, since insoles may be switched between shoes and the mileage won't equate to a single shoe's gear mileage.\n- Users want the ability to display the surface type for a segment, or to filter by surface type when retrieving segments in an activity.\n- Users also note it would be easy for Strava to add rucking features, like weight of ruck and the person.\n- Users find the existing 3D layer in the route creator not useful enough for areas with minor elevation differences and want a topographic layer option for better route planning.\n- Club leaders wish they could anchor routes to the club rather than individual users, so routes persist as leadership evolves.\n\n### Strava vs. Garmin Controversy\n- Strava took to Reddit to explain its side of the story after filing a lawsuit against Garmin, with Chief Product Officer Matt Salazar posting in r/Strava.\n- Many paying Strava subscribers said they would cancel their memberships if Garmin syncing was cut off, emphasizing that Garmin is the reason they use Strava.\n- Commenters argued that Strava already floods the app with challenges and promotions that are far more intrusive than a small Garmin logo.\n- Strava ultimately indicated it would capitulate to some of Garmin's demands, saying \"while we don't agree\" with Garmin's terms, it would change how it attributes data from partners.\n\n### Strava & Mental Health\n- With more than 125 million registered users, researchers at Gustavus Adolphus College wondered whether the fitness positives outweigh the potential mental health negatives, finding that users recognize the app's ability to motivate but also create anxiety.\n- Common gripes on Reddit include people who pause their watches to get better times, or users who cheat to land on leaderboards.\n\n### Recent Developments\n- Strava appears to be rolling out full route navigation and mapping to its watchOS app, bringing long-awaited functionality to Apple Watch users for the first time, allowing them to follow directions directly from their wrist.\n\nThe search didn't surface direct r/Strava posts with titles like \"I wish Strava would...\" but it captured many of the common sentiments and feature requests discussed in the Strava community across Reddit and Strava's own community hub.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"f4f2709e-24b1-44be-84c1-ec0d9de6fa34","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:17:08.977Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"4177b471-be65-4f94-907a-1aea03f1a9fc"}

Bike Score is a function of xPower which is similar to Normalized Power but is based on a 25-second weighted exponential moving average.\n- These are all Phil Skiba's metrics, which are similar to Coggan/WKO's but slightly different.\n\n### Garmin\n- Garmin's equivalent metric is called Exercise Load, and is more similar to RE than it is to TSS. Garmin's metric is based on estimated EPOC, which is the amount of additional oxygen your body uses after finishing the workout. It is used in a similar way to assess cumulative load and the athlete's Training Status.\n- TRIMP is along the lines of Garmin's EPOC Training Load. However, computation of the latter uses FirstBeat's heart rate variability algorithms.\n\n---\n\n## Key Differences in Numerical Output\n\n- Strava uses a different calculation for Training Load compared to Garmin and other programs. Strava uses the term \"Training Load,\" while Garmin and others use the term \"TSS.\" For example, on a recent ride Garmin said TSS of 95 while Strava said 77.\n\n---\n\n## Fitness Tracking & Freshness\n\n### Strava's Fitness & Freshness\n- Strava's \"Fitness & Freshness\" curves are based on what they call an \"impulse response model.\"\n- Strava Fitness = Longer term training load (recent weeks/months). Strava Fatigue = Shorter term training load (recent days/weeks).\n- \"Strava Fitness\" is not fitness, it's training load. Some people call it fitness, as the idea is that increasing your longer term training load will increase your fitness, but it's more precise to call it long term training load.\n- A major criticism: Strava Fitness and Freshness chart is not a serious tool, at least not the last time I looked into it, because your historical Bike Score, short term stress, and long term stress are all recalculated every time you update your FTP.\n\n### Garmin's Training Status\n- Both Training Status and Fitness & Freshness are calculated based primarily on moving averages of \"Training Load,\" and both approaches are pretty interesting based on what the teams who designed them wanted to accomplish.\n- Garmin's \"Training Status\" metric showed statuses like \"Productive,\" \"Peaking\" (well-rested and ready for a big race), and \"Unproductive\" as training load fluctuated.\n- Strava didn't give direct recommendations, but Garmin told the user right then and there that training was getting unproductive and rest was needed.\n\n---\n\n## Strengths and Weaknesses\n\n### Strava Strengths\n- It's simple, multi-sport, and actionable. Serious racers using power meters will still prefer TSS/rTSS in TrainingPeaks or Intervals.icu, but RE remains excellent for day-to-day load monitoring and motivation.\n- Strava's subscription unlocks advanced analytics, goal setting, route planning, and full segment leaderboards.\n\n### Garmin Strengths\n- Garmin is better for serious training and performance analysis, with optimized training load, recovery monitoring, and deep physiological data. It also offers comprehensive health and wellness tracking including sleep, stress, body battery, and overall fitness trends.\n- Based on long-term experience, one reviewer concluded that Garmin has the better set of metrics.\n- Garmin's metrics do a better job of telling the user what is actually happening with his or her body, while Strava's metric doesn't appear to capture much beyond time spent exercising.\n\n---\n\n## Using Both Together\n\nFor many athletes, the optimal solution is a \"both/and\" approach. Garmin and Strava are highly complementary: use Garmin for data acquisition and deep analysis, leveraging Garmin Connect for detailed training load management, recovery insights, and long-term trend analysis. Use Strava for social engagement and motivation — sharing efforts, engaging with other athletes, participating in challenges, and enjoying segments and leaderboards.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nBoth platforms measure training load but use fundamentally different algorithms. Garmin uses EPOC-based calculations with FirstBeat HRV data, while Strava uses a TRIMP-based heart rate zone model. Garmin provides more actionable status labels (Productive, Peaking, Unproductive, Recovery), while Strava offers a simpler Fitness & Freshness chart that is best for broad trend tracking. For the most serious training analysis, many athletes supplement both with platforms like TrainingPeaks or Intervals.icu.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"ce3ea2e9-dcaf-458b-afc0-563258225d29","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:17:22.079Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"dbc620f3-79dd-48e6-8d6e-5243203200a5"}

Users can only view statistics by individual activity type (Hike, Run, Swim, Bike), and want the ability to combine types for accurate yearly and all-time readings.\n\n### 3. **Tracking Non-Run Foot Activities**\nA feature Strava removed that users miss is the ability to track distance and elevation for foot activities that are NOT runs. Users who power walk and hike thousands of kilometers per year can't track yearly accomplishments unless activities are recorded as a \"Run.\" Every bike ride counts, but Strava has made a \"value judgement that says only runs can be counted and tallied up.\"\n\n### 4. **Treadmill Run Limitations**\nStrava won't count treadmill runs for Best Efforts — only outdoor runs. Users also report that treadmill run splits synced from Apple Watch show up completely different when imported to Strava, with paces appearing much slower than recorded.\n\n### 5. **Gear Management (Shoe Tracking)**\nUsers want to be able to back-date miles on shoes added to a gear list — like adding a starting date easily — so shoe mileage is accurate.\n\n### 6. **Price Increases & Paywalled Features**\nStrava has come under fire for its huge price hikes, and users are frustrated to see features like maps, routes, and monthly progress stats behind a subscriber paywall. The app has some competition from alternatives like Nike Run Club and Runkeeper (owned by Asics), which are seen as more affordable.\n\n### 7. **Leaderboard Integrity & Flagging Issues**\nUsers cancelled paying memberships because of clearly erroneous or fake KOM entries, and Strava was \"impossible to contact about such issues\" — flagging an activity with a clear explanation would never get a response. Strava has started addressing this: new machine learning models aimed at detecting irregular efforts resulted in 4.45 million activities being removed from leaderboards earlier in 2025.\n\n### 8. **Customer Support**\nTheir customer service reportedly replies to questions 2 weeks after they're sent. Users say they \"do not have customer service\" — tickets are handled by bots, or infuriatingly, are simply closed without a response.\n\n### 9. **Leaderboard Navigation UX**\nWhen sorting a Segment Leaderboard, clicking on a person's name from page 8 and then clicking \"Back\" returns to page 1, forcing users to navigate back to where they left off.\n\n### 10. **Instant Workouts / Workout Export Limitations**\nUsers note workarounds are needed to get Instant Workout routes onto Garmin devices — saving the route, downloading the GPX from the web version, and uploading to Garmin Connect — because Strava lacks proper device/workout export.\n\n### 11. **Year in Sport Timing**\nSubscribers have requested that the Year in Sport summary be generated at the start of January instead of early December, since many athletes are still trying to accomplish goals throughout December, and the early release doesn't give an accurate picture of total year stats.\n\n### 12. **API Restrictions Angering Power Users**\nSome users cancelled Premium after Strava's API changes, as they relied on pushing data to other apps. Developers who built personal tools using the Strava API had hoped Strava would improve the API and add missing features, but instead the platform restricted access further.\n\n### 13. **Social Media Sharing Regression**\nUsers have noted that the activity display for social media sharing was downgraded — showing less detail and \"not really showing anything except stats,\" compared to earlier versions that included more visual information.\n\n### What Strava Has Recently Added (2024–2025)\nOn the positive side, Strava has been adding features that address some longstanding requests:\n- **Training Zones**: Providing insights into time spent in each power, pace, or heart rate zone across a week, month, or 3-month period.\n- **Athlete Intelligence improvements**: Adding virtual run/ride data, power insights, and segment analysis, and moving the feature out of beta.\n- **Performance Predictions**: Giving runners predicted times for classic race distances — 5K, 10K, Half, and Full Marathon.\n- **Night Heatmaps and Weekly Heatmaps**: Showing where people exercise after dark and where they moved in the last 7 days.\n- **Route Builder redesign**: A fully redesigned mobile interface making route planning faster and more dynamic.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b9808d69-6027-42fe-ae68-b1bf967a4afa","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:17:31.414Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"cfa41800-6578-46af-ad83-063681fa8225"}

Default Zone Calculation is Overly Simplistic\nBy default, Strava determines heart rate zones by estimating max heart rate based on age, using the formula 220 minus age. While this works for a large number of athletes, it may not work for everyone. Many users find that this generic formula doesn't reflect their actual physiology. A common observation is that if max heart rate was calculated from an app, \"there is a 90% chance that it is wrong.\"\n\n### 2. Custom Zones Don't Display or Apply Correctly\nSome users report that the custom heart rate zones listed in settings don't correspond to the max heart rate they've entered. For example, one user set a max HR of 175, but the custom zones displayed corresponded to 190 BPM. Despite the wrong zones appearing unchecked, \"they are very well applied.\"\n\n### 3. Custom Zones Break Relative Effort Scores\nThis is one of the most widespread complaints. Users who adjusted HR zones from the default to Karvonen-based ones discovered that even though the change boosted time in zone 4, it halved the Relative Effort (RE) score. Strava has acknowledged \"some differences in calculations between custom zones and max HR\" and said they are \"investigating ways to make these more accurate,\" but offered no ETA for a fix.\n\n### 4. Relative Effort Doesn't Reward Zone 2 Training\nUsers doing large training efforts see only minor Relative Effort scores. For example, one runner did a 30km run with an average HR of 145, but Strava gave it a Relative Effort of only 89, showing basically no \"fitness increase.\" This creates a conundrum: conventional training wisdom says \"run slow to get faster\" and \"build fitness by running slowly,\" yet Strava doesn't recognize these runs as improving fitness.\n\n### 5. Max Heart Rate Changed Automatically\nSome users discovered that their max heart rate was \"automatically changed in the app (not by me),\" causing weird data issues where all past activities were updated with incorrect heart rate zones.\n\n### 6. Zone Updates Don't Apply Retroactively\nStrava has confirmed that \"updating your heart rate zones will only affect future activities,\" which frustrates users who want consistent historical analysis.\n\n### 7. Only Five Zones Available\nStrava (and Garmin, TrainingPeaks, etc.) all use five zones, a system which some coaches consider \"fundamentally flawed.\" Critics point out it's \"strange that Strava and Garmin on their websites talk about the importance of heart rate, and monitoring efficiency on a recovery ride; yet neither of them have a Recovery Zone!\"\n\n### 8. Optical HR Sensor Inaccuracy\nAn additional layer of inaccuracy comes from the heart rate source itself — \"Optical HR is inherently inaccurate.\" This compounds any zone-calculation issues.\n\n### Recommended Fix\nFor athletes who know their specific heart rate zones, Strava allows customization by entering max heart rate in profile settings and selecting the Custom Heart Rate Zones option to slide zone endpoints along the scale. However, as noted above, using custom zones can negatively affect Relative Effort calculations.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"5884ce32-87a8-4f5f-a85f-2e5d39c2581f","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:18:04.284Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"1cbbed6d-824b-4dba-8f07-408c8c476bf5"}

Here's a comprehensive breakdown:\n\n### What Is It?\n\nRelative Effort, found on the activity details page, measures how much cardiovascular work went into any activity that has heart rate data or Perceived Exertion. Developed in collaboration with Marco Altini, PhD and owner of HRV4Training, Relative Effort is Strava's proprietary metric that quantifies the total cardiovascular (internal) training load an athlete experiences during a workout.\n\n### How Is It Calculated?\n\nThe engineers at Strava created a model that takes in a stream of data—an athlete's heart rate and a corresponding timestamp. Using the athlete's max heart rate (either entered by the athlete or estimated), this heart rate data is divided into a number of zones that approximate different levels of cardiovascular intensity. For each heart rate zone, the model applies a coefficient to weight the time spent in that zone.\n\nYou're given extra points for time spent \"in the red,\" which is any time you spend in Heart Rate Zones 4 or 5. (This is all based on a 5-zone approach.)\n\n### What Makes It Useful?\n\n- **Cross-sport comparison:** A short and hard activity can require just as much effort as a long and leisurely one, and Relative Effort makes it so you can compare the two. Different activity types are weighted so that your efforts can be compared across sports, and your values are personalized to your own heart rate zones so you can even compare with other athletes.\n\n- **Cross-athlete comparison:** If you and a friend both ran your hardest 10K effort, your Relative Efforts would be similar even if your finishing times are different.\n\n### How Did It Replace Suffer Score?\n\nFor those who have used Strava for a while, you may remember \"Suffer Score.\" The new Relative Effort model similarly uses the time you spend in different heart rate zones to score an activity. Now, however, there are a few key differences: It weights the intensity of effort more than duration. It is better at weighting equivalent efforts across sports. It scores equivalent efforts by different athletes similarly.\n\n### Weekly Effort Tracking\n\nRE scores are cumulative and their total over a week makes up your Weekly Effort. If a week isn't complete, you'll see your total for the week so far.\n\nRE is displayed using a graph with a typical white \"range\" band (based on a 3-week average), with color-coded weekly trends:\n\n- **Within range (Green):** Your training is similar to your 3-week average, which can help build or maintain fitness while lowering the risk of overtraining.\n- **Below range (Blue):** You're taking it easy. (This isn't a bad thing.) Down weeks are a great way to recover from big efforts or gear up for more.\n- **Above range (Orange/Red):** You're straining more than usual this week. Big efforts can help lead to fitness gains but be sure to follow them with proper recovery.\n\n### Important Things to Remember\n\nThe important thing to remember about RE is that it's, as the name suggests, relative. The number itself isn't as meaningful as comparing those RE scores, to see where you've been putting in the hard efforts and where you've been taking it easier. Assuming most of us shouldn't be working out at maximum effort all the time, a higher RE score isn't necessarily better. If you're on a recovery day or week, you'll be looking for those RE scores to be lower.\n\nRelative Effort is only available for subscribers on activities that contain heart rate data or have a Perceived Exertion entered.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"0ba227df-20cc-4b4f-8e30-8b3e08fd9bca","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:18:08.495Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"8c022b90-b112-4dc7-b3b3-8f33e5ecb921"}

Unlike other race predictors that rely on theoretical inputs like estimated VO2 max, Strava only uses real activity data to predict race results. The race distances supported are the 5K, 10K, Half, and Full marathon. To see predictions, a subscriber must upload at least 20 run activities within a rolling 24-week window.\n\n### Common Complaints\n\n**Predictions too slow / conservative:**\n- Some users report the predictions are \"SO wrong.\" One runner raced a 10K and the Race Prediction on that activity said 2 minutes slower than their actual time. This user was a collegiate athlete who had been doing triathlons for 10 years and described feeling \"gaslit by these inaccurate predictions.\"\n- Another runner who regularly runs 5K under 22 minutes reported that Strava gives a prediction of just under 25 minutes, calling the feature \"completely useless.\"\n- One marathon trainee found Garmin predicted a half marathon in 1:45:33 while Strava said 2:03:44. They ran 1:50:43, and even after that result, Strava still listed the predicted time at 1:53:37 — slower than what they had just run.\n\n**Predictions don't reflect recent performances:**\n- One runner on LetsRun reported running a sub 15:40 5K a month prior, yet Strava was predicting a 5K time of 16:23, despite averaging 50 miles per week since. They concluded \"it is off for me.\"\n\n**Taper/rest penalized:**\n- A user suggested the algorithm should factor in rest/taper as a positive, not a de-training factor.\n- Strava may be more conservative in its predictions, especially if recent training volume has dipped, as its model tends to \"penalize\" dips in fitness quickly.\n\n**Multisport athletes underserved:**\n- Some runners noted that the platform doesn't understand multisport training. One triathlete running around 30 miles per week but training ~20 hours/week total felt the system \"just tosses that to the side & thinks I have zero endurance off of lower mileage.\"\n\n### Strava vs. Garmin Comparison\n- Garmin sometimes assumes ideal race conditions and may offer more optimistic estimates. For many runners, Garmin's predictions feel like \"best-case scenario\" goals, while Strava's are more grounded in recent form.\n- Some users report that Garmin times are \"pretty much right on\" while \"the Strava times are a joke,\" and express frustration that Strava hasn't fixed the algorithm.\n\n### Some Positive Feedback\n- Not all feedback is negative — some users report the feature is \"actually accurate\" and that their predicted race times were correct.\n- In one Tom's Guide test, a runner ran a 10K in 31:54, and Strava was the closest predictor among Strava, Garmin, and Coros. However, the best prediction came from the runner's coach, who was just one second off.\n\n### Alternative Approaches\nSome data-savvy runners have built their own prediction tools, frustrated that most tools ignore the full training data history and instead lean on a single run to sum up fitness.\n\nIn summary, the most common complaint is that Strava's predictions tend to be **too conservative**, especially for experienced or multisport athletes, and that the algorithm is overly sensitive to reduced training volume while being slow to respond to positive fitness gains.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"131d0fa9-dd6d-47d2-8418-a17e3585a912","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:18:10.670Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"3781cc4f-912f-4e51-a554-8765eb5b8054"}

This means that many of its features are more broad, with a major focus on easily integrating with popular devices and engaging with social media.\n- **Segments & Route Finding:** Strava lets you use segments to inform training and bring in analysis. You can see all the segments you hit along the way and look at past performances to see how you're progressing.\n- **Free Version:** With the free version of your Strava account, you get the basic features without advanced metrics.\n\n---\n\n## TrainingPeaks: Strengths for Runners\n\n- **Superior Analytics:** TrainingPeaks provides a much more detailed, useful analysis of workouts than Strava. A premium account is required to see this level of data.\n- **Serious Athletes & Coaches:** TrainingPeaks is the more serious, analytical tool where runners can dial in every part of their training to get the outcome they want. It is used by the majority of World Tour cycling teams, professional triathletes, and serious age groupers.\n- **Coach Integration:** You can use it to work with a coach who has access to your account and who can set you workouts, analyse your data, plan your year, and leave comments under workouts.\n- **Training Plans:** Athletes can purchase a training plan from tens of thousands of coaches from all around the world who have uploaded template plans for any event you can think of.\n- **Fitness Tracking:** While the fitness tracking capabilities of Strava are quite rudimentary, TrainingPeaks uses the most robust system out there to track fitness and fatigue.\n- **Advanced Metrics:** If you want every training data metric like FTP, Training Stress Balance (TSB), and more, then TrainingPeaks is a way better option.\n- **Device Compatibility:** TrainingPeaks connects to more fitness devices and other apps than any training app on the market. If you want to synchronize your fitness data with a less popular fitness device (like Coros or Suunto), TrainingPeaks will work for you.\n\n---\n\n## Fitness Metrics Comparison\n\nBoth sets of metrics are calculated on the same principle, based on work by Dr. Eric Bannister, but will differ in their implementation. The two main variables which could differ between the two platforms are the calculation of the training impulse from power meter or heart rate data. Users have noted that Strava's Fitness graph is a lot more volatile — it goes down significantly more between long runs where there tends to be the most training load.\n\n---\n\n## Pricing\n\n- TrainingPeaks is a free-to-use application with an additional premium version that runs to about $20/month (this reduces to $10/month if bought on an annual basis). You can typically get a discount on the monthly cost if you bundle it with an actual training plan.\n- TrainingPeaks is around double the cost of Strava, but it offers more than twice the value for the serious athlete.\n\n---\n\n## Who Should Use Which?\n\n- If you're a more casual runner and love the social aspect of running, then using Strava could be a great choice. You can track metrics from your training sessions (especially with the paid version) and also connect with a huge number of runners.\n- If you value detailed analysis, plenty of graphs and charts, and an ideal tool for endurance athletes who want to get the most out of every workout — then TrainingPeaks probably fits your needs.\n- **Use both?** Many experts recommend signing up for both so they populate with data from your fitness devices, even if you don't use them both concurrently. From polls of TrainingPeaks users, many of them also have Strava accounts. Having premium accounts for both is a luxury, however, and a number of the added features of Strava Premium (Fitness and Freshness details) are captured by the free version of TrainingPeaks.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"caf87026-dc56-4c50-98e7-71190746e811","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:18:19.671Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"03f2da9b-6465-4a2d-b8f4-4bfe30679c4d"}

Activity Streams\n\n\"Streams is the Strava term for the raw data associated with an activity.\" All streams for a given activity or segment effort will be the same length and the values at a given index correspond to the same time.\n\nStreams are available in 11 different types. If the stream is not available for a particular activity it will be left out of the request results. The stream types are: **time**, **latlng**, **distance**, **altitude**, **velocity_smooth**, **heartrate**, **cadence**, **watts**, **temp**, **moving**, **grade_smooth**.\n\n**Units & interpretation:**\n- Distance is in meters, and the HR stream is in beats per minute.\n- If you get the streams with the parameter `series_type=time`, then every entry in the time stream is a second and its index corresponds with the same index in the other streams.\n\n**Resolution:**\n- The `resolution` parameter indicates the desired number of data points: 'low' (100), 'medium' (1000) or 'high' (10000). However, this param is not officially supported by the Strava API and may be removed in the future.\n\n**Data variability:**\n- Some activities have a data record for each second, while others have records for every few seconds. There can also be sparse formats with only a few records for the entire activity, or large gaps without any data record. This makes implementing a general solution for interpreting the data really hard.\n\n**Endpoint:** `GET /activities/{id}/streams` — External applications may only access this information for activities owned by the authenticated athlete.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Laps (via `getLapsByActivityId`)\n\nEach lap object returned by the API includes the following fields:\n\nLap fields include: **id**, **resource_state**, **name**, **activity** (nested object), **athlete** (nested object), **elapsed_time**, **moving_time**, **start_date**, **start_date_local**, **distance**, **start_index**, **end_index**, **total_elevation_gain**, **average_speed**, **max_speed**, **average_cadence**, **device_watts**, **average_watts**, **lap_index**, and **split**.\n\n**Key notes:**\n- Activity Laps are created by your compatible device. Most devices are set to auto-lap at 1 mile or 1 kilometer, but you can disable this feature and create your laps manually. Additionally, you can program your device to lap at different times or distances for a structured workout.\n- The API mirrors what is displayed in Strava, which is why short laps may be removed.\n- If the beginning or end of an activity is hidden, data returned by the laps endpoint may not be aligned with the stream endpoint.\n\n**Known issues:**\n- The API can send incorrect `start_index` and `end_index` data for short activities (less than 5km). For example, a lap with distance of 1000m might have an end_index where the stream data only shows 300m.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Splits (`splits_metric` / `splits_standard`)\n\nSplits are returned as part of the **DetailedActivity** object. The `DetailedActivity` includes **splits_metric** (the splits of the activity in metric units, for runs) and **splits_standard** (the splits in imperial units, for runs), as well as **laps** and **best_efforts**.\n\nEach split object contains the following fields (based on the API response):\n\nSplit fields include: **distance**, **elapsed_time**, **elevation_difference**, **moving_time**, **split** (split number), **average_speed**, **average_grade_adjusted_speed**, **average_heartrate**, and **pace_zone**.\n\n**Splits vs. Laps:**\n- Split times are calculated using moving time on run activities loaded to Strava. This calculation happens during the upload process and is not related to any laps your device has recorded. The splits default to miles or kilometers based on your preferred measurement. You don't need to take any action to generate splits on your activity.\n\n**Important notes:**\n- Splits are not exactly at the 1km mark because they are based on recorded data. Most devices record 1 data point per second, and unless speed is constant and evenly divides into 1000m, you likely won't end up with a data point at exactly the 1km mark.\n- Alternatively, you can pull the full data stream and calculate the splits yourself by estimating/interpolating the intermediate distances. You'd get a better estimate since you would have the speed at each data point.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Data Type | Endpoint | Key Fields |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Streams** | `GET /activities/{id}/streams` | time, latlng, distance, altitude, velocity_smooth, heartrate, cadence, watts, temp, moving, grade_smooth |\n| **Laps** | `GET /activities/{id}/laps` | id, name, elapsed_time, moving_time, distance, start/end_index, total_elevation_gain, average_speed, max_speed, average_cadence, average_watts, lap_index, split |\n| **Splits** | Part of `GET /activities/{id}` (DetailedActivity) | distance, elapsed_time, elevation_difference, moving_time, split, average_speed, average_grade_adjusted_speed, average_heartrate, pace_zone |\n| **Best Efforts** | Part of DetailedActivity | Automatically computed PR efforts (e.g., 5K, 10K) |\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b204fc0c-1556-453d-99a0-a5ef238d31a9","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:18:20.955Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"818b9001-2534-4cf5-b4db-efc576d07529"}

It can also be thought of as a portion of a ride that covers a segment. The object is returned in summary or detailed representations.\n\nYou can retrieve a segment effort via `GET https://www.strava.com/api/v3/segment_efforts/:id`.\n\n### Best Efforts\nA community member developing a dashboard app wanted to determine the best effort for an athlete over a 1-mile distance and needed this information via API. However, another user noted that the List Segment Efforts endpoint (`getEffortsBySegmentId`) only gives efforts on segments, and it's unclear how to get the stats from the \"Best Effort\" section directly.\n\nThe activity detail response includes best efforts data. You can set `includeAllEfforts = true` to include all segment efforts in the activity detail response.\n\n### Hidden Attribute on Segment Efforts\nStrava added a `hidden` attribute to segment effort objects returned as part of an activity detail response.\n\nAt the bottom of the segment list, you'll see the option to Show Hidden Efforts, which will display any hidden segments on your ride — which you can then unhide.\n\n### Device Data\nStrava added `device_name` to the activity detail endpoint.\n\n### Perceived Exertion\nPerceived Exertion lets you manually record how intense your efforts feel on a 1-10 scale ranging from \"Easy\" to \"Max Effort.\" Perceived Exertion can power features that otherwise require heart rate data, including Relative Effort, Fitness & Freshness, and Fitness.\n\nOn an activity-by-activity basis, you can choose to use Perceived Exertion instead of heart rate to contribute to Fitness and Relative Effort. The default will be heart rate data or power for rides recorded with a power meter. However, selecting this option allows you to get credit if your recorded heart rate is inaccurate or missing entirely.\n\nThe Strava Enhancement Suite browser extension also supports perceived exertion as a parameter: it allows pre-filling params from URL, including `perceived_exertion` among other fields on the manual upload page.\n\n### Hide Stats Feature\nThe Hide Stats feature will remove the heart rate on your activity and will cause the Relative Effort score to be hidden. You will continue to see the Relative Effort score when viewing your activity, but other athletes will not see the score.\n\n### Strava Live Segments (Device Integration)\nStrava Live Segments is an API that allows users to compare their real-time effort with Strava segment efforts on their device. In addition to using a licensed device/app, the user must have access to the Strava Live Segments feature via Strava Subscription. To validate access, use the `getLoggedInAthlete` endpoint, which returns a `summit` boolean field — if TRUE, the user should be allowed to use Strava Live Segments on the device.\n\n### Other Relevant API Changes\n- Strava introduced `sport_type` for activities, which is the preferred field moving forward, as opposed to `type`, which is now considered deprecated.\n- Laps and pace zones were added to the activity detail endpoint, along with a laps-specific endpoint.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"890e5363-16d0-4789-8a1e-853332c67e74","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:18:52.596Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"27853c1f-141b-428d-a7f7-040118fd63e6"}

The method for calculating Fitness, Fatigue, and Form is based on an impulse-response model first developed by Dr. Eric W. Banister in 1975.\n\nYou'll notice the score rises quickly after consecutive hard days, but it also drops quickly if you take rest days. Form is simply the difference between Fitness and Fatigue. Being in form, or \"peaking,\" happens when one has very high fitness but low fatigue.\n\n### Community Requests for Rest Day Features\nSome Strava users have expressed frustration with the platform's approach to rest days. The fitness tracker has been criticized for making users over-train, with community members suggesting it should suggest rest days and allow manual input of rest days and periods of illness.\n\n### Strava's Relative Effort for Overtraining Prevention\nStrava's Relative Effort feature can help manage effort and determine when you need rest. The Weekly Effort view shows your total relative effort for the week, trending week over week, and provides a weekly Relative Effort range that represents an estimation for an activity level that allows you to maintain or build fitness while minimizing the risk of overtraining.\n\nDown weeks are a great way to recover from big efforts or gear up for more. If you're straining more than usual, big efforts can help lead to fitness gains but be sure to follow them with proper recovery.\n\n### The Importance of Rest in Training\nRest does not come at the expense of more training but instead creates the possibility for more training.\n\nRest and recovery are not the same. Athletes need adequate recovery to train progressively, but in many cases it's possible to recover without total rest. Sometimes total rest is necessary; other times relative rest (i.e., doing less) is sufficient. Finding the specific combination of hard workouts, relative rest days, and total rest days enables you to maximize your overall training load while always getting enough recovery.\n\n### Overtraining and Supercompensation\nYou become fitter during the rest and recovering phase, rather than while you are actually exercising.\n\nYou can assess your state by asking how long it has been since you were fully recovered: if it's days, you should be able to get fitter; if it's weeks, you may be in a state of nonfunctional overreaching; if you have not been fully recovered for months, you have overtraining syndrome.\n\nAttempting to keep building your Fitness score indefinitely is a one-way ticket to hitting a plateau, poor performance, overtraining/under recovery and potentially illness/injury. You need to ensure that you're planning rest/recovery days during each week and also regular \"recovery weeks\" where you dial your training volume right down — for most riders, three weeks of build followed by an easier recovery week is recommended.\n\n### Practical Recommendations\nIt is also very important to take one full rest day per week, where activity is limited to nothing more than a short walk or some stretching. Good periodisation of training stimulus and recovery results in beneficial performance adaptation, known as functional overreaching, which stimulates anabolic (muscle building) hormones like IGF1 and testosterone while keeping stress hormones like cortisol low, leading to steady improvement in performance.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"8341a35c-74a5-4e40-a6be-e922bbab83f6","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:19:00.748Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"5a3cfe71-8b1a-4dc6-b1ac-953efc78b0cc"}

Strava takes no account of that; the fitness number is useless.\n\nMany users feel that the fitness chart is just an activity log and that it really doesn't accept recovery as part of a training plan.\n\n### 2. **Misleading Terminology Promotes Overtraining**\nSome argue it shouldn't be called \"Fitness\" because it doesn't reflect fitness. And if someone wants this graph to keep going up, they need to exercise harder and harder, which would inevitably lead to a burnout.\n\nThe problem with focusing on that single line is that it drives people to try and push it as high as possible — \"higher number equals a fitter athlete, right? Not exactly.\"\n\n### 3. **Inaccurate Due to FTP and Heart Rate Calibration Issues**\nThe various scores are calculated based on your FTP. Therefore, if your FTP is inaccurate, all of the data in the graph will be inaccurate.\n\nOne user noticed that runs were generating a lot of fitness while bike efforts of similar length and intensity were not, due to their Strava max HR not being set properly — intense threshold efforts on the bike were registering as zone 1 rides. \"Bottom line is garbage-in, garbage-out.\"\n\n### 4. **Doesn't Reflect Real-World Performance Improvements**\nOne user reported that their fitness had apparently dropped 12% in the past 12 months, yet they improved their half marathon time from 1:47 to 1:28 and their marathon time from 4:04 to 3:18.\n\nAnother user training for a 100-miler said their Strava chart showed declining fitness when in reality their aerobic fitness went up significantly — they handled heat much better and recovered quickly from long training runs.\n\n### 5. **Poor Handling of Cross-Training and Non-Cycling Activities**\nSome users call it an \"absolutely useless feature,\" noting that high-intensity 90-minute weight training sessions generate far less relative effort than a simple 30-minute commute ride to the office, even when using a chest HR monitor.\n\n### 6. **Technical Glitches with Estimated Power**\nSome users' Fitness & Freshness graphs are completely skewed by outdoor rides with wildly inaccurate estimated power values, which screws up the entire chart.\n\nWrist-based heart rate monitors in cold weather can read 1.5 times actual heart rate, giving crazy high Relative Effort scores that completely skew the Fitness & Freshness to the point where it is meaningless.\n\n### 7. **Display Issues**\nThe chart's scale starts at zero, but when fatigue exceeds fitness, Form goes negative. When viewing the Form line, it puts the lowest value at zero even if it's negative, making the Form chart line appear higher than it should be.\n\n### What Experts Say\nPhysiologist Trevor Connor warns to \"be very careful about focusing on that line,\" noting that it's all relative based on the level of the athlete, and \"there's a lot of interplay with other factors, and there are limitations to the tool.\"\n\nStrava itself acknowledges that the chart can be difficult to understand at first, and that the overall numbers aren't as important as general trends — it's best to compare where you are now to times in the past when you were fit.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"783df7ea-5064-4e34-810e-51e78d34398d","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:19:01.409Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"dee67433-906d-4dc7-956a-e5363897da64"}

AI \"Athlete Intelligence\" Feature Mocked\nIn October 2024, Strava introduced Athlete Intelligence as a paid AI-powered feature providing personalized insights based on activity data. The only problem was that users largely saw it as a complete waste of time and mocked it. The first week of the feature drew skepticism from even its most avid users, who viewed Athlete Intelligence as the latest gimmick in the AI explosion. One user told Fortune, \"It just feels more like a meme than anything right now.\" One Reddit user commented that the tool \"doesn't add value and probably costs them a ton of money.\"\n\n### 2. Third-Party App Ecosystem Shut Down\nIn November 2024, Strava closed third-party app access with a policy change — third-party apps would now only be allowed to display Strava activity data related to a specific user to that user. In other words, Strava shut down the entire app ecosystem that users loved. Third-party platforms like Crickles were prevented from using any Strava user data in their heart health analysis — genuine medical research stymied by Strava's new terms and conditions. Some users cancelled their Strava subscriptions in response.\n\n### 3. Strava vs. Garmin Feud — Reddit Backlash\nStrava's Reddit post explaining its stance against Garmin backfired, receiving 0 upvotes and more than 1,400 comments. Users made it clear that if they had to choose between their app subscription and their expensive running watch, they would choose their Garmin, and accused Strava of hypocrisy. Many pointed out what they saw as hypocrisy, given Strava's own history of restricting API use by third parties in 2024.\n\n### 4. Broken Routes Feature for Runners\nSince a Routes update, users reported they could barely find any routes of any distance from their physical location, whereas pre-update they could find many. Even the functionality was worse with how you set the length of the route to search for, with some debating not renewing their subscription. Users called it a bug, saying Strava \"completely destroyed this feature.\"\n\n### 5. Feed Algorithm Hiding Race Activities\nUsers reported that races and important runs were not appearing in followers' feeds, while warmups were. One user noted their daughter's parkrun PB didn't show in their feed, but her \"boring warm up\" was visible. Several people on Reddit reported the same problem, suggesting it might be a new algorithm not working as intended.\n\n### 6. Poor UI/UX Updates in the Mobile App\nThe recent changes in the Strava app made managing photos and activities frustrating — when trying to delete automatically added photos from Zwift, it's too easy to accidentally delete an entire workout because the delete option is in the same place as the three-dot menu. Users complained that basic UX guidelines were violated — photos went from being easily accessible to being three clicks away, causing users to scroll past friends' activities without engaging.\n\n### 7. Apple Health Sync Broken\nA Strava update removed the ability to have activities sync from third-party devices (Garmin, Zwift, etc.) to Apple Health. Rides recorded on a Garmin that synced to Strava would no longer appear on Apple Health. Suffice to say, users weren't pleased.\n\n### 8. Limited Stats for Non-Running Activities\nUsers complained that Strava removed the ability to track distance and elevation for foot activities that aren't runs. One user who power walks and hikes 3,000–4,000km a year noted they can't track yearly accomplishments unless activities are recorded as a \"Run\" — Strava made a value judgment that only runs can be counted and tallied up.\n\nOverall, there was a time that Strava was a well-loved app, but lately it seems that the fitness app has traded user goodwill and gotten nothing in return.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"8418eb65-0ad9-45e4-aa9e-0eb41f122bc8","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:19:04.303Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"f4d5d184-dc0c-4b12-9b9e-648db1c95959"}

The progress chart allows you to see key metrics and totals for a specific sport or the combined efforts of several sport types across several time ranges.\n- The progress chart displays your totals for distance, time, elevation, or activity count data.\n- The Relative Effort graph shows the cumulative training load from your week so far. It also indicates how you're trending week over week and provides a weekly Relative Effort range, shown by the white band in the middle of the graph. This area gives you a suggested range to hit based on your three-week average.\n- Strava subscribers can set weekly, monthly, and annual goals for all of your favorite sport types using the Strava Mobile App. You can also choose the type of goal: distance, time, or elevation.\n\n### Key Limitations\n\n#### 1. Fixed Monday–Sunday Week (No Customization)\nIf you are looking at the individual week Stress Scores, or weekly goals, all of it will tie back to the Mon-Sun week. There is no individual override, although that would be nice, to make your personal week custom to Wed-Tues or anything else. Garmin and others allow you to alter the day to start your week on, Strava likely limits this due to the need to standardize different comparisons on leaderboards and challenges.\n\n#### 2. No Rolling 7-Day View\nIf I tap on Progress then Relative Effort on the app, it evaluates your effort so far this week (even if it is only Monday or Tuesday), and compares it to your target range for the WHOLE week. So even if you have done a huge workout on Monday, but not quite hit your target range for the WHOLE week on the first day of the week, it will tell you that \"your activity level has been lighter than usual\" which is factually incorrect and misleading. This is a major frustration for users. For those who do most of their exercise at the weekend, this will incorrectly show that \"your activity has been lighter than usual\" for 6 days of every week, which makes the whole screen useless.\n\n#### 3. No Cross-Sport Aggregation in Progress Charts\nThe Progress page (iOS app) lets you limit hours done by activity but it does not allow you to summarize all to the same graph. Users have requested a \"total\" button to see overall time across all sport types for the week compared with previous weeks.\n\n#### 4. Activity Type Tracking Bugs\nThe bar chart on the dashboard has had issues only showing bars for road runs, and not showing bars for trail runs — despite the fact that the calculation of total running mileage above the chart is accurate (includes both). Users also noticed something strange with time-based running goals on the web version — trail runs weren't showing up in the \"Goals\" section.\n\n#### 5. Limited Graph History\nThe graph will only display a year of data at a time.\n\n#### 6. Imperfect Intensity Metrics\nWeekly intensity is an imperfect metric and based on a combination of power output or heart rate during the workout efforts. No amount of tracking totals on Strava or any other app will tell you how balanced the workouts are.\n\n#### 7. Limited Contextual Training Insights\nTracking performance isn't necessarily about trying to get faster or go further. Strava's week-over-week comparisons focus primarily on volume metrics (distance, time, elevation) and relative effort, but lack deeper analytics like pace progression trends, workout-type breakdowns, or periodization analysis that more advanced training platforms provide.\n\nIn summary, while Strava offers basic week-over-week progress visualization and relative effort tracking, users are frequently frustrated by the rigid Monday–Sunday week structure, lack of rolling averages, limited cross-sport aggregation, and occasional bugs with activity type tracking. Many of these have been raised as feature requests on Strava's community Ideas Board but remain unresolved.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"23834999-3aa4-47f1-ac68-f7948cd3c013","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:19:04.848Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"4c5ea4fe-ed57-44b6-8473-668181513799"}

When creating or updating an activity, you can pass `description` as \"Description of the activity.\"\n\n### `workout_type`\nThe `workout_type` field represents \"The activity's workout type\" and is `[optional]`. The `workout_type` is \"a bit undocumented.\" However, community developers have reverse-engineered the integer values. The known mappings are:\n- **Run**: `0` = None, `1` = Race, `2` = Long Run, `3` = Workout\n- **Ride**: `10` = None, `11` = Race, `12` = Workout\n\nNote that \"run and ride have different values (generally ride has run value + 10 except for 'workout')\" and \"since it isn't documented Strava could change it at any time.\"\n\n### `suffer_score`\nStrava added `suffer_score` to the \"activity summary endpoint.\" This is Strava's **Relative Effort** metric. You can use \"the `suffer_score` in the activities\" to calculate fitness/freshness in your own app, as Strava doesn't provide a dedicated endpoint for that. The Relative Effort is basically \"calculated by totaling all suffer_score from the same day.\"\n\n### `calories`\n`calories` is a `float` type representing \"The number of kilocalories consumed during this activity\" and is `[optional]`. Importantly, Strava chose to \"Remove calories attribute from the activity summary endpoint,\" meaning it is now only available on the **DetailedActivity** (i.e., when fetching a single activity by ID), not in summary/list responses.\n\n### `gear` and `gear_id`\n`gear_id` is a `str` — \"The id of the gear for the activity\" `[optional]`, and `gear` is a `SummaryGear` object `[optional]`. Strava removed the \"gear object from activity summary, provide gear_id instead,\" so the full `gear` object (with brand, model, etc.) is only on the DetailedActivity. You can clear gear from an activity \"by passing 'none' for gear_id on activity update.\"\n\nThe `SummaryGear` object includes fields like: alpha-numeric gear ID, distance for the bike/shoes, brand name, model name, and description of the bike/shoe item.\n\n### `notes` (Private Notes)\nThere is no officially documented field called `notes` in the DetailedActivity schema. Community discussion suggests you could \"add that information into the title/description/private notes of their activity,\" but private notes do not appear to be exposed as a standard API field in the current Strava V3 API documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Example JSON Snippet (from official docs)\nFrom the official Strava API reference, a DetailedActivity response includes fields like:\n`\"gear_id\" : \"b453542543\"`, `\"workout_type\" : null`, `\"description\" : null` among many other fields in the JSON response.\n\n### Key Notes\n- Strava API usage is \"limited on a per-application basis\" with \"200 requests every 15 minutes, with up to 2,000 requests per day.\"\n- `sport_type` has been introduced as \"the preferred field to use moving forward, as opposed to type, which is now considered deprecated.\"\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"abcfcd82-49f1-42ba-b52b-8135b055aa8d","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:19:43.470Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"fd9e7ba3-0aee-4759-8eae-4c0c3c7a6cc4"}

The acute load is the average training volume or intensity from the past 7 days, while the chronic load is the rolling average from the past 28 days. Dividing the acute load by the chronic load gives you your ACWR.\n\nResearchers such as Hulin proposed the concept of ACWR innovatively in 2014, defined as the ratio of 1-week acute workload to 4-week chronic workload, and applied it to cricket for the first time.\n\n### The \"Sweet Spot\" for Injury Prevention\n\nThe recommended range for progression and injury prevention is generally considered to be an ACWR of 0.8 to 1.3. Here's what the ranges mean:\n\n- **ACWR < 0.8:** This indicates a significant drop in training load. While this is what you want during a recovery week or taper, a prolonged period in this range can lead to \"detraining\" and also increased injury risk.\n- **ACWR 0.8–1.3:** This is suggested to be the optimal range for sustained, healthy training. Crucially, an ACWR above 1.0 indicates that you are building fitness.\n- **ACWR ≥ 1.5:** The athlete is considered not well-prepared and likely at an increased risk of sustaining acute or overuse injuries if the acute workload exceeds the chronic load (i.e., ACWR ≥ 1.5).\n\nAn International Olympic Committee consensus statement on sports injuries endorsed the idea of a sweet spot minimizing injury risk between 0.8 and 1.3, with substantially greater risk when ACWR exceeds 1.5.\n\n### Calculation Methods: Rolling Average vs. EWMA\n\nThere are two main ways to calculate ACWR:\n\n1. **Rolling Average (RA):** The standard model treats all training sessions within the 7-day or 42/28-day windows equally.\n2. **Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA):** The EWMA model has been shown to have greater sensitivity to detect increases in injury likelihood in comparison to the RA model. The EWMA model is also more sensitive to day-to-day changes in workload and will allow practitioners to better detect where an athlete sits on the ACWR spectrum. This allows practitioners to prevent athletes from entering the \"danger zone.\"\n\n### Strava Integration & Tools\n\nMost runners now use wearables that track workouts and store information on platforms such as Strava. In most cases this data is then used to produce performance charts using variations of the Fitness-Fatigue Model, often also showing the Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR).\n\nThere is also a dedicated R package called **Athlytics** that can compute ACWR directly from Strava data. It computes the Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) from local Strava activity data using rolling average methods. ACWR is a key metric for monitoring training load and injury risk in athletes. It supports multiple load metrics including TSS (Training Stress Score) using normalized power and FTP, and HRSS (Heart Rate Stress Score) using heart rate reserve.\n\n### Application to Running\n\nFor example, if you've run 50 miles this week (acute) and averaged 40 miles per week over the past 4 weeks (chronic), your ACWR is 1.25.\n\nA study investigated differences between 4 methods when calculating change in training load in running: weekly training load, ACWR coupled rolling average, ACWR uncoupled rolling average, and ACWR EWMA. The study was part of a randomized controlled trial on running injury prevention among recreational runners.\n\n### ACWR vs. the Old \"10% Rule\"\n\nAlmost all runners will have heard of the 10% rule — \"increase by no more than 10% a week.\" While the 10% rule can be a decent starting point for a novice, it's a very blunt instrument. It doesn't account for workout intensity, or your individual capacity for adaptation.\n\n### Criticisms and Limitations\n\nDespite its popularity, ACWR has its critics:\n\n- There has been backlash, with some scientists pointing out flaws in both the theory and evidence supporting the use of the ACWR. In a review in Sports Medicine, researchers from McGill University led by Ian Shrier sum up the case against it.\n- Since it's a ratio, it doesn't reflect the absolute size of the load. Someone who increases mileage from 10 miles a week to 15 miles a week would have the same injury risk as someone who jumps from 100 to 150 miles a week.\n- The predictive value of ACWR for injury risk has been debated in recent literature. Some researchers argue that ACWR may have limited utility for predicting injuries, and a subsequent analysis has called for dismissing the ACWR framework entirely. Users should interpret ACWR risk zones with caution and consider them as descriptive heuristics rather than validated injury predictors.\n- Although ACWR is associated with sports injury risk and may be useful in injury prevention strategies, it is necessary to use it with caution as a tool for measuring workload. Due to heterogeneity between studies, potential publication bias, or differences in ACWR calculation methods, these factors may affect research results.\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nACWR remains a widely used and intuitively useful framework for runners looking to manage training load and reduce injury risk. Platforms like Strava provide the underlying data needed to calculate it, and third-party tools can automate the process. However, it should be used as one of several tools in a training toolkit rather than as a standalone injury predictor.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6b9353b5-587b-469f-80ac-e4f15892f6f7","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:20:30.918Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"eb4afa63-1e43-4eb1-b5b2-be29626d348d"}

It requires the `profile:read_all` scope.\n\n### How to Call It\n\nThe endpoint is accessed via a GET request to `https://www.strava.com/api/v3/athlete/zones` with an Authorization Bearer token.\n\n## Heart Rate Zones\n\n- Strava automatically calculates heart rate zones based on your Max Heart Rate, which by default is estimated as 220 minus your age.\n- If no age is provided, Strava defaults to a Max Heart Rate of 190 bpm.\n- Zones will automatically update on your birthday unless you have manually set a Max Heart Rate.\n- Subscribers have the option to set different heart rate zones for runs/other sports and rides.\n\n## Power Zones\n\n- Power zones are determined by your Functional Threshold Power (FTP) and reflect the intensity distribution of your cycling workouts. If you have an FTP entered, your power zones are automatically calculated from it.\n- If you upload activities with power data but no FTP, Strava uses the last 6 weeks of your activity data to generate a Critical Power Curve, and your FTP will automatically update as new data becomes available.\n- The power brackets provided by Strava's API are broken up into 50W chunks up to 450W and then a single bracket to catch all time spent above 450W.\n- A power meter for your bike is required to view your power zones.\n\n## Running / Pace Zones\n\n- For running activities, Strava provides 6 Pace Zones.\n- Laps and pace zones were added to the activity detail endpoint.\n\n## Athlete Zones vs. Activity Zones\n\nIt's important to distinguish between the **athlete-level zones** and **activity-level zones**:\n\n- The `/athlete/zones` endpoint will get you the athlete's HR zones. If you'd like to know how much time was spent in each zone for a specific activity, you need a different endpoint (the activity detail endpoint).\n- If you retrieve 100 activities and want to know their heart rate zones, you have to make 1 request for each activity—currently there's no batch endpoint to get zone data for multiple activities at once.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n- The maximum configurable values are: FTP of 500 and Max Heart Rate of 230 bpm.\n- The power brackets, heart rate zones, pace zones, and suffer scores are only calculated by Strava and provided via their API for users who have a Strava Premium membership.\n- The athlete zones endpoint was originally added to the API to display heart rate zones and has since been expanded to include power zones as well.\n- Training Zones provide insights into Heart Rate, Power, and pace, allowing you to track progress across sports, by category, and over various timeframes—7 days, 1 month (4 weeks), and 3 months (12 weeks).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"7d4c76d7-6525-4ccd-8cc3-f2c9ae629bb7","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:21:00.297Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"9e47a6c7-3cc7-4cb5-a8a5-9d2915357d65"}

It combines both your aerobic capacity (VO2max) and running economy into a single score. Developed by legendary coach Dr. Jack Daniels and exercise physiologist Jimmy Gilbert, the VDOT system is one of the most trusted methods for determining training paces and predicting race times in distance running.\n\nVO2 max measures maximum oxygen consumption in a lab setting, while VDOT is a running-specific measure that accounts for running economy and real-world performance. VDOT is more practical for runners as it translates directly to training paces and race predictions.\n\n### Strava Integration with VDOT\n\n**Strava Stats App (by Paul Reidy):**\nThe developer wanted to include a feature to automatically calculate the VDOT based on all activities that were uploaded to Strava and marked as races. This would allow you to estimate overall fitness at different points in time. The app calculates VDOT by reverse-engineering the RunSmart Project calculator's API, making POST requests to get VDOT calculations and equivalent race results.\n\n**V.O2 App (Official VDOT Platform):**\nV.O2 currently syncs with Apple, Coros, Garmin, Polar, Strava and Suunto. VDOT is a score that represents your current running fitness and determines what intensities you need to train at to improve performance.\n\n### How to Use a VDOT Calculator\nEnter your most recent race distance and finish time—ideally a hard effort, not a training jog. The VDOT calculator helps runners measure aerobic fitness using Jack Daniels' science-backed formula. It estimates your VO₂ max and gives you target paces for easy runs, tempo sessions, intervals, and race pace workouts.\n\n### Equivalent Race Performances\nBy using VDOT numbers you can establish realistic targets for upcoming races based on \"equivalent pacing.\" The VDOT chart plots what a well-trained runner at a given VDOT value is likely to run across varying distances. For example, if your VDOT is 44 and you've done the appropriate distance training, you should be capable of running a 1:42:17 half marathon.\n\n### Best Practices\n- 5K and 10K races typically give the most reliable VDOT estimates. They're long enough to be primarily aerobic but short enough that most runners can give a true maximum effort. Half marathons also work well.\n- Recalculate every 4-8 weeks or after a race where you performed well. As your training progresses, your VDOT should gradually increase. Use updated values to adjust your training paces accordingly.\n- A critically important point to understand is that you train at your current paces, not the paces associated with your goal VDOT value.\n\n### Useful VDOT Calculator Links\n- **V.O2 Calculator** (official): [vdoto2.com/calculator](https://vdoto2.com/calculator)\n- **RunSmart Project**: [runsmartproject.com](https://runsmartproject.com)\n- **Sport Calculator**: [sport-calculator.com](https://sport-calculator.com/calculators/running/vdot-running-calculator)\n- **Strava Stats App** (with Strava integration): [reidy-p.github.io/strava-stats](https://reidy-p.github.io/strava-stats/)\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"748e8e22-b77c-4164-bd2e-12d4615b43bc","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:21:01.185Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"1f2004c9-d6f0-4fbc-bf2c-7d10928d00bd"}

Activity analysis includes all the Coggan metrics and others only found on Intervals.icu, with automatic interval detection — no need to use the lap button — along with power, HR, cadence, W'bal, speed, pace, and more than 50 different metrics for each interval.\n\n- **Automatic FTP Estimation:** It offers automatic FTP estimation (eFTP) from a single maximal effort — no need for tests.\n\n- **Fitness/Freshness Tracking:** The monitoring of total load and periodisation does a reasonable job of adding runs and rides of different intensities (by HR or power or pace if neither is available).\n\n- **Customizability:** It is a little overwhelming looking at first, but users figure it out as they go, and it's super customizable as far as how much or how little data is displayed.\n\n- **Workout Builder:** The workout builder is really nice — you can build everything as a % of threshold pace, then as you get faster you update your threshold pace and it auto-updates the paces in your pre-made workouts.\n\n- **Pricing:** Intervals.icu is free but asks users to consider supporting the project with a $4/month subscription.\n\n- **Coaching Features:** Coached athletes can understand how their plan works, monitor progress, and communicate with their coach; coaches can spend less time analyzing data and more time talking with athletes.\n\n### Noted Drawbacks:\n- New users may find the extensive features and data presentation overwhelming at first, requiring time to become familiar with the interface.\n- The developers are focusing on cycling and thus focus on power as a KPI; however, some runners don't use the power figures for running.\n\n---\n\n## Runalyze — Key Features Runners Want\n\n- **Race Predictions:** Runalyze has effective VO2max which determines race prediction on a day-by-day basis, taking into account how more or less fit a runner is over a season.\n\n- **Depth of Analysis:** Runalyze is free and has more analytics than most users need — it's a bit clunky but users like the depth it goes into.\n\n- **Database & Search:** The database of activities and searching is considered better with Runalyze, while the summary graphs/analysis are preferred in Intervals.icu.\n\n- **Pricing:** Some runners pay for Runalyze, describing it as reasonably priced and geeky, with great tools but a definite learning curve.\n\n---\n\n## How They Compare (User Perspectives)\n\n| Feature | Intervals.icu | Runalyze |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Graphs & Summaries** | Preferred by users | — |\n| **Activity Database/Search** | — | Preferred by users |\n| **Race Predictions** | Requested as a feature | Built-in with VO2max |\n| **Training Load Monitoring** | ✅ Strong (fitness/freshness) | ✅ Available |\n| **Customizability** | Highly customizable | Less flexible UI |\n| **Cost** | Free (optional $4/mo) | Free tier + paid options |\n| **Strava Sync** | ✅ | Can be finicky |\n\nSome runners use both Runalyze and Intervals together, noting they'd sooner pay for either than Strava — setting up all three sites to pull data from Garmin.\n\nOne notable observation is that there can be major contradictions in recovery status among Runalyze, Garmin, and Intervals.icu, showing different readiness levels from the same data.\n\n---\n\nIn short, runners looking for Strava alternatives gravitate toward **Intervals.icu** for its powerful, customizable training load and analytics dashboards, and toward **Runalyze** for its deep activity database, VO2max tracking, and race predictions. Both are significantly cheaper than Strava Premium or TrainingPeaks.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"7983a252-d3f8-42c3-87b5-05b74618f1f7","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:21:14.241Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"98aed845-cbff-4ab4-bdaf-d495b4378db5"}

It is only available for the authenticated athlete.\n\nThis is the recommended endpoint when polling for athlete upload events.\n\n### Authentication\n\nYou must pass the athlete's identifier (`id`) as a `Long` parameter, and it must match the authenticated athlete. All calls to the Strava API require an `access_token` defining the athlete and application making the call.\n\n### Response Structure\n\nThe response includes the following stat groups:\n\nThe stats object includes fields like `all_ride_totals`, `all_run_totals`, `all_swim_totals`, `biggest_climb_elevation_gain`, `biggest_ride_distance`, `recent_ride_totals`, `recent_run_totals`, `recent_swim_totals`, `ytd_ride_totals`, `ytd_run_totals`, and `ytd_swim_totals`.\n\n### `recent_run_totals` Fields\n\nThe `recent_ride_totals` (and similarly `recent_run_totals`) object includes the following fields:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `distance` | float | Total distance in meters |\n| `achievement_count` | integer | Number of achievements |\n| `count` | integer | Number of activities |\n| `elapsed_time` | integer | Total elapsed time in seconds |\n| `elevation_gain` | float | Total elevation gain in meters |\n| `moving_time` | integer | Total moving time in seconds |\n\n### Example Response (recent_run_totals)\n\nA typical `recent_run_totals` response looks like:\n```json\n\"recent_run_totals\": {\n    \"count\": 3,\n    \"distance\": 13058.400146484375,\n    \"moving_time\": 4632,\n    \"elapsed_time\": 4726,\n    \"elevation_gain\": 70.25619125366211,\n    \"achievement_count\": 3\n}\n```\n\n### Python Example\n\nYou can call the endpoint using the Swagger-generated client like so: configure your access token, create an `AthletesApi` instance, and call `api_instance.getStats(id)` where `id` must match the authenticated athlete.\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- Using the `/athletes/{id}/stats` endpoint, you will only get counts for rides, runs, and swims. Other activity types are not broken out separately.\n- The default overall rate limit allows 200 requests every 15 minutes, with up to 2,000 requests per day.\n- Some users have reported that the `all_*_totals` fields (e.g., `all_run_totals`) have occasionally reset on the API to start counting from 0, even though the Strava portal shows a much higher number. Strava's API team has acknowledged and reproduced this bug and opened a ticket to address it.\n\n### Official Documentation Links\n\n- **API Reference**: https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/#api-Athletes-getStats\n- **Getting Started**: https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/\n- **Swagger Playground**: https://developers.strava.com/playground\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a938db0b-42bc-4297-801e-e43965ea3ca7","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:21:40.202Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"d092a7ab-971e-440d-b1a0-a6b68d8e0741"}

This is a long-standing and widely requested feature.\n\n### Feed Filtering (Not Yet Available)\n\nCurrently, **Strava does not offer the ability to filter activity types in your social feed.** Users have submitted this as a feature request multiple times going back years, calling it \"basic filtering Excel has been doing for decades\" and noting that \"a programmer could knock this out in a week, easy.\" Some users are so frustrated that they've had to unfollow or mute people because they post multiple dog walks, lawn mowing, gym activities, etc., that clutter up the feed.\n\nOne user shared they'd been \"eagerly anticipating this feature for quite some time\" because their feed had become \"rather overwhelming with Virtual rides and various activities,\" to the point where they were \"seriously contemplating not checking out Strava anymore.\"\n\n### \"My Activities\" Filtering (Partial Support)\n\nFor your **own** activities, there is some filtering available. One commenter noted this is \"already implemented\" with options to search and filter by Distance, Elevation, Dates, Time, and Type of activity. However, the implementation has notable gaps — for example, you can't exclude Treadmill activities from runs (the checkbox means \"only Treadmill\" rather than \"include Treadmill\"), and there are no options for searching subcategories like Trail Run.\n\n### Walks Counting Toward Running Challenges (Major Controversy)\n\nA particularly heated issue emerged in early 2024: Walks were added to running challenges as of January 2024, which has \"ruined the experience of challenges\" for users who do both running and walking as separate sports.\n\nUsers expressed being \"so so frustrated that walks are now added to runs,\" saying it would force them not to track walks at all. Many feel \"the addition of walking activities has diluted the achievement of earning the RUN 100k in a month.\"\n\nSome users found a workaround: Since hikes do not count toward running challenges, some mark their walks as hikes instead, though they acknowledge \"this is just stupid.\"\n\n### Workarounds Suggested by the Community\n\n- **Mute individual users** who post unwanted activity types (but you lose all their content)\n- **Mark your own non-essential activities as private** so they don't appear in others' feeds\n- Use third-party add-ons like \"commutemarker\" that can automatically define activities starting and ending at set points as commutes, which can then be filtered out.\n- Go to the Progress section of the \"You\" tab on the Strava mobile app, where you can select \"run\" and view your progress over a selection of time frames (subscribers only).\n\n### Strava's Response\n\nSome community members believe the admins haven't thought the changes through and suspect user feedback \"hasn't been passed up the chain.\" Strava has stated the post \"will remain open and our Team will continue to monitor your feedback,\" but no concrete changes have been announced.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"0c9367e0-ef32-4ade-a6a7-32fa60d1cfe1","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:21:50.363Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"1f7d8293-f2fb-4adf-9e93-4791a948ce37"}

Let me compile the comprehensive list of user pain points.\n\n---\n\n# Strava User Pain Points Research: 30+ Real User Complaints and Questions\n\n## Compiled Research Report\n\nBelow is a comprehensive catalog of real user pain points, complaints, and unmet needs gathered from Reddit, the Strava Community Hub, running forums (LetsRun, TrainerRoad, Slowtwitch), review sites, and specialist blogs (DCRainmaker, the5krunner, Science4Performance). For each pain point, I note whether it could be addressed by building an AI coaching layer on top of the Strava API.\n\n---\n\n### CATEGORY 1: Training Load, Fitness, and Recovery (The Biggest Gap)\n\n**1. \"Strava's Fitness & Freshness chart doesn't actually measure fitness\"**\nUsers report improved race times (half marathon from 1:47 to 1:28) while Strava shows declining \"fitness.\" The metric is just chronic training load, not actual fitness. Users want VO2max, performance trends, and real fitness indicators.\n- **Solvable via API + AI?** YES. The API provides HR streams, pace, distance, and best efforts. An AI layer can calculate VDOT from race efforts and track actual performance improvement over time.\n\n**2. \"Strava doesn't tell me when to rest\"**\nGarmin provides \"Training Status\" labels (Productive, Peaking, Unproductive, Recovery) but Strava offers no recovery guidance. Users say the fitness graph \"doesn't accept recovery as part of a training plan\" and \"encourages bad training patterns leading to burnout.\"\n- **Solvable?** YES. ACWR (Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio) can be calculated from activity history via the API. An AI coach can flag when ACWR exceeds 1.5 (injury danger zone) or drops below 0.8 (detraining risk) and recommend rest days.\n\n**3. \"How do I see my training load? Strava's Relative Effort is confusing\"**\nUsers don't understand what Relative Effort means or how to use it. The number itself is opaque -- a proprietary TRIMP variant. Users ask: \"What does a Relative Effort of 89 actually mean for my training?\"\n- **Solvable?** YES. The API exposes `suffer_score` (which is Relative Effort). An AI layer can contextualize it: \"Your long run today (RE: 156) was your hardest effort in 3 weeks. Consider an easy day tomorrow.\"\n\n**4. \"Relative Effort doesn't reward Zone 2 training\"**\nRunners doing long slow runs (the foundation of endurance training) get tiny RE scores. A 30km run at HR 145 earned an RE of only 89 -- Strava showed basically no fitness increase. This contradicts the \"run slow to get fast\" principle.\n- **Solvable?** YES. An AI coach can analyze time-in-zone distribution from HR streams and explain that Zone 2 volume is building aerobic base even when RE is low.\n\n**5. \"Custom heart rate zones break Relative Effort scores\"**\nUsers who set physiologically correct custom HR zones (e.g., Karvonen-based) find their RE scores halved. Strava acknowledged \"some differences in calculations\" but offered no fix.\n- **Solvable?** YES. An AI layer can calculate its own training load metrics from raw HR stream data using the athlete's actual zones, bypassing Strava's broken RE calculation.\n\n**6. \"Strava's heart rate zones are wrong (220-age is inaccurate)\"**\nThe default 220-minus-age formula doesn't work for many athletes. Users also report max HR being changed automatically without their input, and zone updates not applying retroactively.\n- **Solvable?** YES. The API provides the athlete's configured zones via `/athlete/zones`. An AI layer can detect if zones appear miscalibrated (e.g., athlete never reaches Zone 5 in hard efforts) and suggest corrections.\n\n**7. \"I want to see my ACWR (Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio) for injury prevention\"**\nStrava provides no injury risk metric. The ACWR sweet spot (0.8-1.3) is a widely used framework in sports science, but Strava doesn't calculate or display it.\n- **Solvable?** YES. This is a core calculation that can be performed from activity history (distance, duration, suffer_score). The pace-ai server already implements this.\n\n**8. \"Strava's Fitness & Freshness is skewed by bad data\"**\nWrist HR monitors in cold weather read 1.5x actual HR. Estimated power values are wildly inaccurate. One bad reading can skew the entire chart for weeks.\n- **Solvable?** PARTIALLY. An AI layer can detect anomalous HR or pace data (e.g., HR of 220 sustained for 30 min) and flag or exclude outliers from analysis.\n\n---\n\n### CATEGORY 2: Race Predictions and Performance Analysis\n\n**9. \"Strava's race predictions are too conservative / inaccurate\"**\nA runner who ran sub-15:40 for 5K was predicted at 16:23. Another ran a 1:50 half but Strava predicted 2:03. The algorithm penalizes tapers and doesn't account for cross-training.\n- **Solvable?** YES. VDOT and Riegel calculations from actual race/best-effort data are more transparent and can be tuned. The pace-ai server already implements these.\n\n**10. \"I want automatic race predictions from my training data\"**\nUsers want predictions that update as fitness changes, not just after entering a race result.\n- **Solvable?** YES. The API exposes `best_efforts` (auto-detected PRs for standard distances) and full activity streams. VDOT can be computed from best efforts and updated weekly.\n\n**11. \"How do I compare my runs week over week?\"**\nStrava's progress chart shows volume (distance/time/elevation) but not pace progression, workout quality, or periodization analysis.\n- **Solvable?** YES. The API provides all the raw data. An AI layer can generate week-over-week comparisons of average easy pace, long run distance, interval quality, and total load.\n\n**12. \"I can't see pace trends or whether I'm actually getting faster\"**\nNo built-in tool to answer \"Am I running faster at the same heart rate compared to 3 months ago?\" (cardiac drift / aerobic decoupling analysis).\n- **Solvable?** YES. HR and pace streams from the API enable pace-at-HR analysis over time. This is a classic measure of aerobic fitness improvement.\n\n---\n\n### CATEGORY 3: Workout Classification and Context\n\n**13. \"Strava includes rest times in my overall pace for workouts\"**\nWhen doing intervals, standing recovery inflates average pace. Users marking activities as \"workout\" expect the rest to be excluded from pace calculations.\n- **Solvable?** YES. The API provides laps and streams. An AI layer can identify interval segments vs. recovery and calculate workout-specific metrics (e.g., average interval pace, recovery pace, total work time).\n\n**14. \"How do I know if my easy runs are actually easy enough?\"**\nUsers debate whether their easy pace is correct. No Strava feature maps HR to training zones and tells you \"your easy run was actually in tempo territory.\"\n- **Solvable?** YES. HR stream data + athlete zones from the API can flag runs where HR was too high for the intended effort. An AI coach can say \"Your 'easy' run averaged Zone 3 -- slow down by 30 sec/mile.\"\n\n**15. \"I want to know what type of training I've been doing (polarized? threshold? junk miles?)\"**\nUsers want training distribution analysis -- what percentage of runs are easy, tempo, threshold, interval. Strava's Training Zones feature is new but limited.\n- **Solvable?** YES. Activity streams + HR zones allow classification of each run's intensity profile and aggregate distribution analysis.\n\n**16. \"Strava doesn't understand structured workouts\"**\nStrava can't tell the difference between a tempo run and an easy run with the same average pace if the tempo had negative splits. It doesn't parse workout structure.\n- **Solvable?** YES. Lap data and pace/HR streams from the API can detect workout structure (intervals, tempo blocks, progression runs) automatically.\n\n---\n\n### CATEGORY 4: Activity Management and Data Organization\n\n**17. \"I can't search my activity history to find a specific run\"**\nUsers describe finding old runs as \"like finding a needle in a haystack.\" No text search, location search, or advanced filtering.\n- **Solvable?** YES. The API provides activity metadata (name, description, location, date). An AI layer can index and search across all activities.\n\n**18. \"I can't filter out non-running activities from my analysis\"**\nThe feed and progress charts mix walks, hikes, gym sessions. Walks now count toward running challenges, diluting achievements.\n- **Solvable?** YES. The API provides `sport_type` for filtering. An AI coaching layer can focus exclusively on running activities.\n\n**19. \"Treadmill runs don't count for Best Efforts\"**\nIndoor runs are excluded from PR tracking, frustrating treadmill runners who train through winter.\n- **Solvable?** PARTIALLY. The API includes treadmill activities but without GPS. An AI layer can track treadmill PRs separately if pace data is available from the watch.\n\n**20. \"Strava only shows 20 activities at once on the Activities page\"**\nUsers with years of data find navigation painful.\n- **Solvable?** YES. The API supports pagination with `per_page` up to 200 and `page` parameters. An AI layer can present a richer activity history view.\n\n**21. \"Shoe tracking doesn't let me backdate mileage\"**\nUsers adding shoes to Strava after already running in them can't set starting mileage.\n- **Solvable?** YES. The API provides `gear_id` per activity and gear details. An AI layer can calculate total gear mileage including pre-Strava estimates.\n\n---\n\n### CATEGORY 5: Social and Motivational Gaps\n\n**22. \"Strava's AI Athlete Intelligence is a joke / meme\"**\nThe AI feature launched in 2024 was widely mocked as unhelpful, providing generic comments that \"don't add value.\"\n- **Solvable?** YES. This is exactly the gap a serious AI coaching layer should fill -- providing genuinely useful, personalized, context-aware training insights rather than generic quips.\n\n**23. \"I want to compare my training with a friend's\"**\nBeyond segment leaderboards, users want side-by-side training comparisons: weekly volume, pace trends, race predictions.\n- **Solvable?** PARTIALLY. The API only exposes data for the authenticated athlete. Comparison would require both athletes to authorize the app.\n\n**24. \"Activities disappear from followers' feeds (algorithm issues)\"**\nImportant races don't show up while warmups do.\n- **Solvable?** NO. This is a Strava platform issue outside API control.\n\n---\n\n### CATEGORY 6: Data Quality and Interpretation\n\n**25. \"What does all this data actually MEAN for my running?\"**\nThe fundamental gap: Strava shows numbers but doesn't interpret them. Users see pace, HR, elevation, cadence, splits -- but don't know what to do with any of it. As one user put it: \"Strava tells me WHAT happened but not WHY it matters.\"\n- **Solvable?** YES. This is the core value proposition of an AI coaching layer. Translate data into actionable advice: \"Your cadence dropped 8% in the last 5K of your long run -- this suggests late-race fatigue. Add strides to your easy runs to improve.\"\n\n**26. \"Why are my splits so uneven? How do I pace better?\"**\nUsers see large pace variations between splits but don't know if that's a problem or how to fix it.\n- **Solvable?** YES. The API provides splits with per-km pace. An AI layer can calculate pacing variability, flag positive/negative split patterns, and coach pacing strategy.\n\n**27. \"What training zones should I be running in for my goal?\"**\nUsers training for a marathon want to know their target paces for easy runs, tempo runs, and intervals -- but Strava doesn't map goals to training zones.\n- **Solvable?** YES. VDOT from best efforts yields Daniels training paces (Easy, Marathon, Threshold, Interval, Repetition). The pace-ai server already implements this.\n\n**28. \"How do I know if I'm ready for my race?\"**\nNo taper guidance, no readiness assessment, no \"you're on track for sub-4:00 marathon\" feedback.\n- **Solvable?** YES. Training load trends, VDOT trajectory, and ACWR approaching race day can inform readiness assessment. An AI coach can say \"Based on your last 12 weeks, you're on track for a 3:52 marathon. Begin your taper now.\"\n\n---\n\n### CATEGORY 7: Platform and API Limitations\n\n**29. \"Strava killed the third-party app ecosystem\"**\nIn November 2024, Strava restricted API terms so third-party apps can only show a user's own data to that user. This shut down community analysis tools.\n- **Relevance:** The pace-ai architecture (showing each user only their own data via OAuth) is fully compliant with these new terms.\n\n**30. \"Strava's API rate limits are restrictive (200 req/15 min, 2000/day)\"**\nDevelopers building analytics tools hit limits quickly when fetching activity streams.\n- **Relevance:** The strava-mcp server should implement caching and efficient batch strategies.\n\n**31. \"The API doesn't expose Fitness/Freshness data\"**\nThere is no API endpoint for the Fitness & Freshness chart values. Developers must calculate their own from suffer_score.\n- **Relevance:** This is exactly what pace-ai can provide -- computing fitness/fatigue/form from raw activity data.\n\n**32. \"The API's suffer_score is the only way to get Relative Effort programmatically\"**\nBut it's undocumented, could change, and is only on DetailedActivity (requiring per-activity API calls).\n- **Relevance:** pace-ai should cache suffer_scores and/or compute its own load metric from HR streams.\n\n**33. \"Strava only has 5 HR zones, and no recovery zone\"**\nCoaches argue the 5-zone model is fundamentally flawed for training prescription. There's no Zone 0/Recovery distinction.\n- **Solvable?** YES. An AI layer can implement a more granular zone model (6-7 zones with recovery/aerobic/threshold distinctions) from raw HR data.\n\n**34. \"Strava's weekly progress resets on Monday -- no rolling 7-day view\"**\nIf you train hard on weekends, Strava shows \"lighter than usual\" activity for 6 out of 7 days, making the feature useless.\n- **Solvable?** YES. The API provides activity dates. An AI layer can compute rolling 7-day metrics.\n\n---\n\n## Hidden API Data Most Users Don't Know Exists\n\nThe Strava API exposes rich data that most users never see in the app:\n\n| API Field | What It Contains | User Value |\n|---|---|---|\n| `best_efforts` | Auto-detected PRs for standard distances (400m, 1/2 mile, 1K, 1 mile, 2 mile, 5K, 10K, 15K, 10 mile, half, marathon) | Track PRs across all runs, not just races |\n| `splits_metric` / `splits_standard` | Per-km/mile splits with avg HR, pace zone, elevation change, grade-adjusted pace | Detailed pacing analysis |\n| `average_grade_adjusted_speed` (in splits) | Grade-Adjusted Pace (GAP) per split | Fair comparison of hilly vs flat runs |\n| `suffer_score` | Relative Effort value | Calculate your own fitness/freshness |\n| `workout_type` | 0=default, 1=Race, 2=Long Run, 3=Workout | Filter by workout intent |\n| `perceived_exertion` | 1-10 RPE scale | Subjective load tracking |\n| `description` | Free-text notes field | User annotations, how they felt |\n| `device_name` | Watch/device model used | Correlate data quality with device |\n| `calories` | Estimated calorie burn | Energy expenditure tracking |\n| `segment_efforts` (with `hidden` attribute) | Every segment crossed, including hidden ones | Detailed segment-by-segment analysis |\n| `laps` | Device-created laps with start/end indices into streams | Structured workout analysis |\n| HR/pace/cadence/altitude streams | Second-by-second raw data | Drift analysis, interval detection, zone time |\n| `gear_id` + SummaryGear | Shoe/equipment linked to each activity | Mileage tracking, correlate gear with injury |\n| `achievement_count` | PRs and CRs earned | Identify breakthrough performances |\n| `/athlete/zones` | Athlete's configured HR and power zones | Personalized zone-based analysis |\n| `sport_type` | Granular activity type (Run, TrailRun, Treadmill, etc.) | Filter and categorize precisely |\n\n---\n\n## Summary: What Pace-AI Can Uniquely Solve\n\nThe research reveals a clear pattern: **Strava excels at data collection and social features but fails at training interpretation and coaching**. The gap between \"here's your data\" and \"here's what it means\" is exactly where an AI coaching layer adds value.\n\nThe top opportunities, ranked by user demand and API feasibility:\n\n1. **ACWR-based injury risk monitoring and rest day recommendations** (users beg for this)\n2. **Real fitness tracking via VDOT/performance trends** (not just training load)\n3. **Training zone distribution analysis** (\"Am I doing enough easy running?\")\n4. **Personalized race predictions** (transparent, from actual best efforts)\n5. **Contextual workout analysis** (\"Your intervals were faster than last week's\")\n6. **Pacing analysis and coaching** (\"You positive-split your long run -- here's how to fix it\")\n7. **Week-over-week and rolling training summaries** (not locked to Mon-Sun)\n8. **Goal-based training zone prescription** (\"For your 3:30 marathon goal, run easy at X:XX pace\")\n9. **Anomaly detection** (bad HR data, unusual effort levels, signs of overtraining)\n10. **Plain-English data interpretation** (\"Your cadence dropped in mile 8, suggesting fatigue\")\n\n---\n\nSources:\n- [Obvious Missing Features That Annoy Me -
