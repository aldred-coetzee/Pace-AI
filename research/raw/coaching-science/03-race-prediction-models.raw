The formula is:\n\n**Pm (sec/km) = 17.1 + 140.0 × exp[−0.0053 × K] + 0.55 × P**\n\nWhere:\n- **Pm** = predicted marathon pace (seconds per kilometer)\n- **K** = mean weekly training distance (km/week)\n- **P** = mean training pace (seconds per km)\n\n### The Four Coefficients\n\nThe values of the four constants are: **C1 = 17.1**, **C2 = 140.0**, **C3 = 0.0053**, **C4 = 0.55**.\n\nAmong the four constants, C1 is an offset value, C2 and C3 rule the relationship between race pace and weekly distance, while C4 is related to the dependence of race pace on training pace.\n\n### How Each Component Works\n\n- **Base Constant (17.1):** This is a fixed value added to the total predicted time. It serves as a baseline, accounting for the minimal time required to complete a marathon, irrespective of the training metrics.\n\n- **Pace Coefficient (0.55 × mean training pace):** This term directly correlates the training pace to the predicted marathon time. A faster average pace (lower seconds per kilometre) results in a quicker marathon time prediction.\n\n- The **exponential term** (140.0 × exp[−0.0053 × K]) captures the diminishing returns of increasing weekly mileage on marathon performance.\n\n### Training Data Window\n\nThis prediction was based on eight weeks of training prior to the marathon (excluding race week itself).\n\n### Original Study Details\n\nThe study involved runners who kept daily exercise records during their marathon training for an overall number of 46 races, whose marathon time ranged from 167 to 216 min. The two key training parameters — mean distance run per week (K) and mean training pace (P) — were combined by a mathematical approach.\n\nThe correlation is able to estimate the marathon performance time with a standard error of estimate (SEE) of about 4 minutes.\n\n### Applicability\n\nFor runners in the 2:47–3:36 range, the values of C1, C2, C3, C4 appear to be independent of the subjects (and gender). Conversely, the predictive correlation adapted to faster runners should probably be corrected on the basis of individual characteristics.\n\nThe relationship between race pace and mean distance run per week is only slightly affected by the athlete performance (i.e., C2 and C3 are likely to be independent of individual characteristics), while faster runners seem to train at a different ratio relative to race pace.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThe equation primarily considers two variables—weekly training distance and average pace—while factors such as terrain, weather, and psychological state also play crucial roles in marathon performance. Moreover, the model assumes consistent training patterns, which may not account for injuries or periods of reduced training.\n\nIt was fitted to 22 runners (46 marathons: 2:47–3:36 finishing time) with a BMI of less than 25. If your marathon finishing time or BMI falls outside of this range the formula will work less well.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"3c06436d-cea5-4a73-b015-9ad66ee6c9bf","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:36:00.920Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"8b061787-d15e-442d-8e30-71d2ebc51684"}

Specifically, David Cameron used a number of times of world-level athletes from 400M to 50 Miles in a non-linear regression model to develop a formula to predict race times.\n\n## The Formula\n\nThe equation is:\n\n**T₂ = T₁ · [D₂/D₁] · [f(D₁)/f(D₂)]**\n\nwhere T₁ is the previous time, D₁ is the distance previously run in meters, D₂ is the new distance to be run in meters, T₂ is the projected time for the new race, and the function f(x) is defined as:\n\n**f(x) = 13.49681 − 0.000030363x + 835.7114/x^0.7905**\n\nThe factor f(D₁)/f(D₂) has the effect of making your time increase by a slightly larger factor than the increase in distance. Equivalently, it makes your time decrease by a slightly smaller factor than the decrease in distance.\n\n### Alternative Representation (in miles)\n\nThe Cameron model can also be expressed as:\n- a = 13.49681 − 0.048865 × olddist + 2.438936/(olddist^0.7905)\n- b = 13.49681 − 0.048865 × newdist + 2.438936/(newdist^0.7905)\n- newtime = (oldtime/olddist) × (a/b) × newdist\n\nNote that in this version the distances are in miles and the times in seconds.\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\n- It's claimed to work best for distances from 800m to the marathon.\n- The Cameron formula is calculated by using a non-linear regression method.\n- This model tends to be more accurate for longer distances like marathons and ultramarathons.\n- It predicts slightly faster times at longer distances compared to Riegel, and is often more accurate for elite runners.\n\n## Example Calculation\n\nFor example, if Tom ran 3.5 miles in 51 minutes and 30 seconds (5632.704 meters in 51.5 minutes), and the week before ran 2.5 miles in 34 minutes and 45 seconds (4023.36 meters in 34.75 minutes), and wants to predict his time to run a 5-mile (8046.72-meter) race:\n\nUsing the Cameron formula on the first set gives T₂ = 51.5 × (8046.72/5632.704) × [f(5632.704)/f(8046.72)] = 51.5 × 1.4285714 × 1.0212319 = 75.1334 minutes, or 1h 15m 8s.\n\n## Limitations\n\n- The Cameron model (like Riegel and VO2 Max models) does not take age and sex into account.\n- The race time predictions will be most accurate for the distances closest to the previous race distance entered.\n- It's also important to use a recent race result, or at least a race result achieved when you were at similar fitness, otherwise the estimate is likely to be off.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"2a98cd5c-982d-4a1e-9854-2206ab444d36","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:36:02.897Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"606ec9f5-0393-49d9-9a9b-8cf67c0f5f83"}

The expression allows for the prediction of race times for runners and other athletes giving a certain performance at another distance. Over the years, the formula has been widely approved by the sports community thanks to its high calculation accuracy and simplicity in its application.\n\n### The Formula\n\n**T₂ = T₁ × (D₂/D₁)^1.06**\n\nWhere:\n- T₁ is the previous race time, D₁ is the distance previously run, D₂ is the new distance to be run, and T₂ is the projected time for the new race.\n\n### What the 1.06 Exponent Represents\n\nThis mathematical formula accounts for the fact that running speed decreases exponentially with distance, not linearly. The 1.06 exponent represents the fatigue factor that increases with longer distances.\n\nThat 1.06 exponent assumes your pace declines predictably as distance increases, doubling the distance increases your time by a factor of about 2.08. The formula works for activities lasting 3.5 to 230 minutes, covering everything from the 1500m to the marathon.\n\n### How the Exponent Varies by Runner Ability\n\nThis is a key nuance of the formula:\n\nResearch has shown that the exponent 1.06 works well for most recreational and competitive runners, though elite athletes may have slightly different values based on their exceptional training and physiology.\n\nMore specifically, Riegel's 1.06 exponent is a starting point. Speed-oriented athletes may fit better with 1.03–1.05, while endurance specialists or ultra runners might trend toward 1.07–1.10.\n\nYou can experiment by noting how your actual race results compare with the default prediction, then nudging the exponent to see which value lines up best. Exponents vary by athlete and distance; recalibrate with each new race result.\n\n### Limitations\n\nSome sites have modified it, stating that the value of 1.06 given for the exponent b in the formula results in seemingly unachievable predictions for longer distances.\n\nThe Riegel formula assumes \"appropriate training for the distance.\" A runner maintaining 40 miles per week simply can't achieve the marathon time that a calculator predicts based on their 5K fitness, no matter how fast that 5K was. The calculators show \"equivalent performance,\" not \"what you could run.\"\n\nThe formula's accuracy decreases for very short race times (less than 3.5 minutes) and very long ones (over 4 hours).\n\n### Alternative Methods\n\nAlternative calculators (Cameron, Daniels VDOT, McMillan) tweak the exponent or incorporate proprietary adjustments, but they follow the same power-law pattern.\n\nIn summary, while 1.06 is the standard default, the optimal exponent is personal: **lower (~1.03–1.05)** for speed-oriented runners and **higher (~1.07–1.10)** for endurance-focused or ultra runners. Tracking your own race performances across distances is the best way to calibrate your personal exponent.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"3d578a1f-f67d-4efc-bdc9-a1b56c134fca","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:36:03.609Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"f8d875ec-1ca9-4735-9050-53f18ed4361f"}

It achieves this by calculating your score based on an actual race performance, rather than a lab test.\n\nDaniels felt lab-based VO2 max testing was impractical for most people and that running economy (i.e., your running form) was also a factor in how runners performed. Efficient runners could run at a faster pace with lower oxygen consumption than an inefficient runner. He combined both VO2 max and running economy into one factor he called VDOT.\n\n## The Daniels-Gilbert Formula\n\nThe calculator uses the scientifically validated Daniels-Gilbert formula to translate your race performance into actionable data. The Daniels-Gilbert formula is one of the most validated running performance models, based on extensive research correlating race performances across distances.\n\nThe core formula (as shown on runbundle.com) involves two components:\n\n1. **Oxygen cost of running** at a given speed (S, in meters/min):\n   - `VO₂ = −4.60 + 0.182258 × S + 0.000104 × S²`\n\n2. **Fraction of VO₂max** sustainable over time (T, in minutes):\n   - `%VO₂max = 0.8 + 0.1894393 × e^(−0.012778 × T) + 0.2989558 × e^(−0.1932605 × T)`\n\nVDOT is then calculated as: **VDOT = VO₂ / %VO₂max**\n\n## How to Use It\n\nEnter your most recent race distance and finish time—ideally a hard effort, not a training jog. Hit \"Calculate\" to get your VDOT score, predicted race times, and personalized training paces.\n\nFor best accuracy, use a recent all-out race effort from the past 4-6 weeks. Races between 3K and half marathon typically provide the most reliable VDOT estimates. 5K and 10K races are particularly good because they're long enough to measure aerobic capacity but short enough to run at near-maximum effort.\n\n## Training Pace Zones\n\nE = Easy (recovery and long runs), M = Marathon pace, T = Threshold/Tempo (lactate threshold work), I = Interval (VO2max development), R = Repetition (speed and running economy).\n\nHere's what each pace zone targets:\n\n- **Easy (E):** Easy pace is easy enough that you can hold a conversation and exert relatively low effort. This pace is used for aerobic development.\n- **Marathon (M):** Used to experience race pace conditions for those training for a marathon or simply as an alternative to Easy pace running for beginners on long run days.\n- **Threshold (T):** Generally in the range of 83-88% of VO2max or 88-92% of HRmax. Threshold pace is comfortably hard running for either a steady 3-4 miles (or 5 to 6km) or repeated runs of 5 to 15 minutes each, with 1 to 3 minutes of rest between the runs. Purpose: To improve endurance.\n- **Interval (I):** Generally in the range of 97-100% of VO2max or 98-100% of HRmax. Intervals are \"hard\", but not all-out running by any means. Intervals are similar to a pace that you could maintain for about 10-12 minutes in a serious race. Intervals are best if they involve runs of 3 to 5 minutes each (800m and 1000m workbouts are common).\n- **Repetition (R):** Reps are fast, but not necessarily \"hard\", because workbouts are relatively short and are followed by relatively long recoveries. Recoveries should be long enough that each run feels no more difficult than the previous run, because the purpose of Reps is to improve speed and economy.\n\n## Equivalent Performances\n\nVDOT assumes that performances at different distances are equivalent when adjusted for distance. It assigns a score to all running performances, lets you determine your current training paces, and equates a race time in one distance to another.\n\nHowever, note that even some locally elite runners have difficulty hitting the marathon equivalent VDOT targets. Many coaches derate the VDOT values from the chart between 1 to 1.5 VDOT points for a half marathon and 2 to 3 points for a full marathon.\n\n## Important Training Principles\n\nA critically important point to understand is that you train at your current paces, not the paces associated with your goal VDOT value. Most coaches recommend about 80% of your weekly volume needs to be at the Easy race pace, with the remaining 20% being speed work.\n\n## Online Calculators & Resources\n\nSeveral free online calculators are available:\n- **[vdoto2.com/calculator](https://vdoto2.com/calculator)** — The official VDOT Running Calculator, designed by Dr. Jack Daniels and the team at VDOT O2.\n- **[rundna.com](https://rundna.com/resources/run-training/vdot-training-tables-how-to-use-them/)** — Includes full VDOT training pace tables.\n- **[runbundle.com](https://runbundle.com/tools/vo2-max-calculators/vo2-max-calculator)** — Shows the underlying formula and projected race times.\n- **[sport-calculator.com](https://sport-calculator.com/calculators/running/jack-daniels-running-calculator)** — Another free implementation of the Daniels-Gilbert formula.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"87a380ad-4bcf-41b7-9a95-339cc570c457","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:36:19.573Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"1be1f678-6d65-47a9-98ea-89c32e770b50"}

The basic formula is:\n\n1. **Age-Graded Time** = Your Actual Time ÷ Age Factor\n2. Your Age-Graded Percentage is then calculated by comparing your age-graded time to the \"open class\" (peak performance) world record for that distance: **Age-Grade % = (Open World Record / Your Age-Graded Time) × 100**.\n\nTo calculate your age graded percent (AGP or AG%), you take your time and divide it by the world record time at that distance, then depending on your age, multiply the resulting percentage by the appropriate WMA Factor.\n\n## Current WMA Tables\n\nThe authoritative calculator of age-grading in accordance with the WMA rules was originally developed by Howard Grubb. World Athletics (WA) and subsequently, WMA, updated their tables, which came into force on **1st January 2023**.\n\nThe Age Factors are used to convert masters performances to equivalent open athletics performances, while the Age Standards are standardised \"world-best\" performances. The current Age Factors, which were revised in 2023, are available through the WMA website.\n\n## How the Factors Were Derived\n\nThe Age Grade Update Committee used millions of performances to establish the factors for each event at each age for men and women. They also compared the factors with performances by individual athletes over many decades of competition to confirm that factors were valid.\n\nThe Five-Year Age Graded Tables are for calculating points for combined events. The One-Year Age Graded Tables are for calculating age graded performances and percentages for each age in all WMA Events.\n\n## 2025 Road Running Tables Update\n\nThe 2025 tables were approved on 2025-01-10 by the Masters Long Distance Running Council (MLDR) of USA Track and Field Federation.\n\nFor the 2025 tables, an improved interpolation scheme for computing age factors for the distances other than 5 km, 10 km, Half-Marathon, and Marathon was introduced. The standards are developed for 5 km, 10 km, Half-Marathon, and Marathon.\n\n## History of Revisions\n\nAge Grading Factors were first officially adopted by World Association of Veteran Athletes (WAVA), now known as World Masters Athletics (WMA), in 1989. They were intended to be used to adjust combined events performances so scores across all age groups would be consistent. Periodically, updated factors were adopted: in 1994, 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2015.\n\nAge Grade tables exist for ages 8 through 100 for all major events.\n\n## Key Resources\n\n- **Howard Grubb's WMA Calculator**: [howardgrubb.co.uk](https://www.howardgrubb.co.uk/athletics/wmalookup15.html) — Although now outdated, it provides the WMA calculator and related information, including Excel files with all the age-grading factors and formulae to embed calculations in competition management software.\n- **RunBundle**: [runbundle.com/tools/age-grading-calculator](https://runbundle.com/tools/age-grading-calculator)\n- **RunHive**: [runhive.com/tools/performance-calculator](https://runhive.com/tools/performance-calculator)\n- **Masters Rankings**: [mastersrankings.com/new-age-grades](https://mastersrankings.com/new-age-grades/)\n- **GitHub (Road Tables)**: [github.com/AlanLyttonJones/Age-Grade-Tables](https://github.com/AlanLyttonJones/Age-Grade-Tables) — includes documentation on how the tables are produced and the latest 2025 road running standards.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"7342712a-2ef4-4f16-ba12-2e2a8b00e775","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:36:55.485Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"caa122dd-87a2-47d9-b929-f2a0b064eb7c"}

Factor Analysis for Marathon Prediction (2024)\nThis paper introduces a novel approach, the Factor Analysis Probabilities Prediction Ranking Machine Learning (FA-PP-R-ML) methodology, for predicting marathon race outcomes. Published in the *Journal of Electrical Systems*, Vol. 20 No. 6s (2024). Machine learning has increasingly become a valuable tool in optimizing training strategies, performance prediction, and injury prevention for marathon runners, analyzing data from wearable devices, training logs, and race results.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Win Your Race Goal: Generalized Running Performance Prediction (2024, PMC)\nThis study introduces a novel approach for predicting running performance across a wide range of race distances (from marathons to ultras), elevation gains, and runner types, analyzing the entire running logs of 15 runners encompassing a total of 15,686 runs using two approaches: regression and time series regression (TSR). The prediction accuracy of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network was compared using both approaches, with the regression approach achieving an accuracy of 89.13% versus the TSR approach at 85.21%. The LSTM model was also compared against two benchmark models: the Riegel formula and UltraSignup formula for a total of 60 races.\n\n---\n\n## 3. XGBoost for 100-Mile Ultra-Marathon Prediction (PLOS One, 2024)\nA machine learning model based on the XGBoost algorithm was built to predict the running speed from the athlete's age, gender, country of origin, and where the race occurred. The model predicts event location (country of event) as the most important predictor for a fast 100-mile race time, with the fastest race courses in Romania, Israel, Switzerland, Finland, Russia, the Netherlands, France, Denmark, Czechia, and Taiwan. The model accuracy score of R² = 0.23 indicates an existing but moderately weak effect of the predicting variables.\n\n---\n\n## 4. XGBoost for 50-Mile Ultramarathon (Scientific Reports, 2025)\nUtilizing a dataset with ultramarathon races from 1863 to 2022, a machine learning model based on the XGBoost algorithm was developed to predict race speed. This was published in *Scientific Reports* in 2025 (Turnwald, Valero, Forte et al.).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Marathon Prediction from Half-Marathon Performance (Frontiers in Physiology, 2025/2026)\nThe main objective of this study was to obtain a prediction of the marathon race time through an equation that included easily accessible data for all runners, such as age group, half-marathon race time, sex, and the variable half-marathon pacing. The average ICC between estimated and real race time was excellent (ICC = 0.92). This study used Valencia Marathon data and compared results against the Daniels' VDOT model.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Learning to Run Marathons (Springer, 2024)\nSmyth, Feely, Berndsen, Caulfield, and Lawlor (2024) published \"Learning to Run Marathons: On the Applications of Machine Learning to Recreational Marathon Running\" in the book *Artificial Intelligence in Sports, Movement, and Health*. This work covers race-time prediction, training plan recommendations, and injury prediction using case-based reasoning and other ML methods.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Pace My Race: Recommendations for Marathon Running\nThis work proposes marathon running as a novel domain for recommender systems and machine learning, using high-resolution marathon performance data (n = 7,931) to build in-race recommendations and outperform existing techniques for in-race finish-time prediction. Through the association of model features and expert domain knowledge, they generate explainable, adaptable pacing recommendations to help runners avoid \"hitting the wall.\"\n\n---\n\n### Key Model Features Used Across Studies:\n- **Training data**: running logs, weekly mileage, wearable device data\n- **Demographics**: age, sex/gender\n- **Race characteristics**: distance, elevation gain, event location/country\n- **Prior performance**: previous race times (e.g., half-marathon time)\n- **Pacing behavior**: in-race split times, pacing strategy/range\n- **Algorithms**: XGBoost, LSTM, ANN, KNN, case-based reasoning, linear regression\n\nThese papers collectively highlight a growing trend toward using deep learning (LSTM), gradient boosting (XGBoost), and case-based reasoning for personalized and generalizable race performance prediction.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"989b3bc4-a93d-4d6c-b0f8-30766440325f","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:36:58.859Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"b503cbb7-df95-46e9-92bd-6738f76ab9db"}

For example, an 18:00 5K result in 80°F temps converts to a 17:25 under ideal conditions.\n\nIdeal conditions for the marathon are between 35–55°F (2–13°C). Across the board, lower humidity is better, but the effects of humidity are not actually noticeable until the air temperature is above around 65°F (18°C).\n\nResearch shows pace drops for every degree above 60°F (16°C), and as humidity rises above 60%.\n\nOne meta-analysis showed an average of a 15% reduction in performance in the heat, though the definition of \"heat\" varied across studies.\n\n### 💧 Humidity\n\nAll runners know that hot weather is about more than just the thermometer. The humidity also affects how efficiently your body can shed heat via sweating, which is why hot and humid conditions are so much worse than a dry heat.\n\nA study on trained male distance runners doing steady state runs at 31°C (88°F) with 23%, 43%, 52%, 61%, and 71% relative humidity found that in hot conditions, rising humidity reduces an athlete's capacity to sustain performance.\n\n### ⛰️ Altitude / Elevation Adjustments\n\nThe Final Surge altitude adjustment calculator (provided by Dr. Thomas \"Tinman\" Schwartz) is intended to correct for race times of non-altitude trained runners who compete at elevations between 1,500 and 8,000 feet above sea level in races lasting 75 seconds or longer.\n\nOne study showed that mean maximal power across durations (5–600s) fell by around 6% per 1,000 m gain in elevation. At altitudes higher than 3,000m, decreases exceeded 11.7%.\n\nA 5% decrease in VO₂max should in theory slow down marathon speed by 5%, though real-world data verification is still needed.\n\n### 🏔️ Grade / Elevation Gain (Uphill/Downhill)\n\nThe core Grade Adjusted Pace (GAP) calculation is based on research by D. B. Dill, who determined that the cost associated with the vertical component of running uphill is 1.31 millilitres of oxygen for every metre climbed per kilogram of weight. This value should hold true unless you're running very steep gradients.\n\nDownhill running yields a speed increase of roughly 55% of the speed decrease suffered from uphill running.\n\n### 💨 Wind Corrections\n\nNot as much is known about wind's metabolic impact on running compared to cycling. Running into a headwind has been shown to decrease metabolic efficiency.\n\nThe energy gain from a tailwind is known to be about half the size of the energy loss due to a headwind, meaning wind effects are asymmetric and a headwind hurts more than a tailwind helps.\n\nWind makes the heat more tolerable, but slows you down if you are running into it because of the drag forces.\n\n### 🔧 Key Calculators & Tools\n\n1. **Fellrnr Running Calculator** – Generates training paces and race predictions with adjustments for temperature, body weight, and altitude.\n2. **VDOT Calculator** – Uses Dr. Jack Daniels' formulas for temperature-adjusted paces.\n3. **Final Surge Altitude Calculator** – Altitude-specific race time corrections.\n4. **Running Writings Heat & Humidity Calculator** – Calculates pace adjustments for running long workouts and races in hot and humid conditions, with input options for heat index, temperature + relative humidity, or temperature + dew point.\n5. **RunBundle GAP Calculator** – Grade-adjusted pace for hilly courses.\n\n### ⚠️ Important Caveats\n\nIndividual variability in heat tolerance is a big consideration, including both baseline variation from person to person and differences attributed to acclimatization. These estimates should be taken as an average effect across runners, not necessarily as a precise estimate for you.\n\nThese adjustments are for the marathon, not other race distances. Shorter races will be affected to a lesser degree.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"c0ed24ab-49da-4d99-a78b-849facca4e52","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:37:00.751Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"1b278d79-7d20-40a0-9420-7c3a929f2a0a"}

Generally, for every 1,000 feet of elevation gain above a certain threshold (often around 3,000 feet), running pace can slow by approximately 1.5-3%. Many calculators use a 2% adjustment per 1,000 feet above 3,000 feet as a general estimate.\n\n### VO₂ Max-Based Models\nVO₂ max decreases approximately 1-2% per 300m (1,000 ft) above 1,500m. Several studies have quantified VO₂max reduction at altitude: Wehrlin & Hallén found VO₂max dropped ~6.3% per 1,000m between 300m and 2,800m in elite endurance athletes, while other summaries suggest 8-11% for every 1,000m ascent. The widely used model uses 7% per 1,000m as the base coefficient.\n\nHowever, race data shows smaller performance changes than raw VO₂max drops — Olympic/World Championship data show 2-4% slower endurance events above ~1,000m. The gap exists because athletes don't use 100% of VO₂max during most races, and running economy moderates the effect.\n\n### Jack Daniels' Practical Guidelines\nTo simplify, figure about 1+ seconds per 400 meters (4-5 sec/mile) per 1,000 feet above 3,000 feet of altitude: at 4,000 ft = 4-5 sec/mile, 5,000 ft = 8-10 sec/mile, 6,000 ft = 12-15 sec/mile, 7,000 ft = 16-20 sec/mile, 8,000 ft = 20-25 sec/mile.\n\nDaniels also reports that, in his coaching and research experience, most runners do not notice the effects of altitude until about 3,000 feet above sea level.\n\n### For Acclimatized Runners\nFigure about 10-15 seconds per mile slower at 5,000 feet of altitude (compared to sea level), and closer to 20 seconds per mile at 7,500 feet altitude. These differences apply if fairly acclimatized to altitude — it will be a little more per mile if a newcomer to altitude.\n\n### Acclimatization Effects\nAcclimatization over 3+ weeks can reduce the impact by about half. Allow 2-3 days for moderate altitudes (1,500-2,500m) and 1-2 weeks for high altitudes (2,500m+).\n\n### Available Online Calculators\n- Final Surge offers a calculator by Dr. Thomas \"Tinman\" Schwartz, intended to correct for race times of non-altitude trained runners who compete at elevations between 1,500 and 8,000 feet above sea level in races lasting 75 seconds or longer.\n- RunReps, RunningPace.net, and Sport-Calculator.com also offer altitude adjustment calculators based on similar VO₂max reduction models.\n\n### Important Caveats\nThis is an evidence-informed estimate based on average responses. Individual variation is significant. Heat, humidity, and course profile can have as much or more impact than altitude alone.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"ff263175-f9a1-48d0-ad0d-33d55a4d233e","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:37:32.414Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"aa5d1bc1-b048-4a13-b963-8d24f3512bdd"}

Fellrnr's page on the **Impact of Heat on Marathon Performance** provides a lookup table rather than a single formula with specific coefficients. Key details:\n\n- Use the 'heat index' or 'feels like' temperatures rather than raw thermometer readings in the table.\n- The actual temperature measurement used is Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), which is similar to 'heat index' given on weather forecasts, but WBGT includes the heat of the sun, which 'heat index' does not.\n- Example usage: You expect to run a 4:20 in 40 degree weather, but it's going to be 70. Looking across the 4:20 line to the 70 degree column you find 4:53, which is a 19% reduction in performance.\n- The study looked at 140 marathon results from 6 races (Boston, New York, Twin Cities, Grandma's, Richmond, Hartford, and Vancouver). Only the first 300 finish times were used, giving a pool of 42,000 finish times.\n- The approach taken is to assume the decline is linear from the end points of each curve.\n\n### Fellrnr's Running Calculator\n\nThe Fellrnr calculator generates training paces and race predictions with adjustments for temperature, body weight, and altitude by estimating V̇O2max and using that to predict race times. The calculator also attempts to compensate for races run in hot conditions, based on the research documented at Impact of Heat on Marathon Performance, and is an estimate only.\n\n---\n\n## Other Popular Approaches\n\n### Temperature + Dew Point Method\n\nFirst, add the temperature and the dew point together (e.g. 80 degrees + 65 dew point = 145). Look up that number in these ranges to determine the percentage of pace adjustment:\n- 100 or less: no pace adjustment\n- 101 to 110: 0% to 0.5%\n- 111 to 120: 0.5% to 1.0%\n- 121 to 130: 1.0% to 2.0%\n- 131 to 140: 2.0% to 3.0%\n- 141 to 150: 3.0% to 4.5%\n- 151 to 160: 4.5% to 6.0%\n- 161 to 170: 6.0% to 8.0%\n- 171 to 180: 8.0% to 10.0%\n- Above 180: hard running not recommended\n\nThe range exists because there are several factors including body size, fitness, physical make-up, and level of acclimation to conditions.\n\n### Simple Per-Degree Formula\n\nOne common coaching rule of thumb: For every degree over 65 degrees Fahrenheit, plan to slow your pace by 2 seconds per mile. So if average pace is 8:15 in 88 degrees: 88 – 65 = 23; 23 × 2 seconds = 46 seconds; resulting in about a 9:01 mile.\n\n### Percentage-Based Calculator\n\nAnother calculator adjusts pace using two components: +0.4% pace increase for every degree Fahrenheit above 60°F, and +0.2% pace increase for every 1% humidity above 60%.\n\n### Running Writings Heat Calculator\n\nThe Running Writings app calculates pace adjustments for running long workouts and races in hot and humid conditions, allowing input of local weather as a heat index, temperature + relative humidity, or temperature + dew point.\n\nIt appears that Fellrnr does not publish a single closed-form formula with specific numerical coefficients, but rather provides a lookup table derived from the study data with linear extrapolation.

The actual VDOT training pace tables from Jack Daniels' *Running Formula* are copyrighted material. Let me share what I can about the VDOT system and direct you to the best resources.\n\n---\n\n## VDOT Training Pace Tables (VDOT 30–85)\n\nThe complete VDOT training pace tables are from Jack Daniels' book *Daniels' Running Formula* and are copyrighted material, so I cannot reproduce the full table here. However, I can provide an overview of the system and direct you to the best resources to look up your specific paces.\n\n### What the VDOT System Is\n\nThe Jack Daniels VDOT system is one of the most trusted methods for determining training paces and predicting race times in distance running. It was developed by legendary running coach Dr. Jack Daniels and exercise physiologist Jimmy Gilbert using the scientifically validated Daniels-Gilbert formula.\n\nVDOT scores typically range from 30 (beginner) to 85+ (elite). Recreational runners often fall between 35-45, competitive amateurs between 45-55, and advanced runners above 55. Elite marathoners typically have VDOT scores above 70.\n\n### The Five Training Pace Zones\n\nE = Easy (recovery and long runs), M = Marathon pace, T = Threshold/Tempo (lactate threshold work), I = Interval (VO2max development), R = Repetition (speed and running economy). Each zone targets specific physiological adaptations.\n\nHere's what each zone means:\n\n1. **Easy (E):** Easy running is run at a very slow pace. Think of Easy running as referring to an intensity that is \"conversational\" in nature. Relative to a hard 100% effort, Easy runs are more in the range of 60-80% effort.\n\n2. **Marathon (M):** Marathon running is an intensity of running equal to the run speed you anticipate maintaining in the upcoming marathon race. Marathon pace is typically at an intensity that is felt to be about 75–85% effort.\n\n3. **Threshold (T):** Threshold running is the intensity at which you perform steady-state runs or cruise intervals. The proper intensity is about 83–88% effort, and at an intensity that could be raced at for almost 1-hour under ideal racing conditions.\n\n4. **Interval (I):** Generally in the range of 97-100% of VO2max or 98-100% of HRmax. Intervals are \"hard\", but not all-out running. Intervals are similar to a pace that you could maintain for about 10-12 minutes in a serious race. Intervals are best if they involve runs of 3 to 5 minutes each (800m and 1000m workbouts are common).\n\n5. **Repetition (R):** Repetition running involves repeating relatively-short (up to 2-minutes) workbouts, at about 1500m or mile race pace, followed by a feeling of full recovery after each workbout. The main idea with Repetition training is to improve speed and running economy.\n\n### Example Paces (VDOT 47)\n\nAs one example, for a VDOT of 47.0 (approximately a 21:00 5K), the training zones are: Easy/Long at 8:39–9:12 per mile, Marathon at 7:40 per mile, Threshold at 7:13 per mile, Interval at 6:37 per mile, and Repetition at 6:13 per mile.\n\n### Some Reference Points\n\n- VDOT 40 predicts approximately a 4:08 marathon, VDOT 50 predicts approximately 3:20, and VDOT 60 predicts approximately 2:50.\n\n### Where to Find the Complete Table\n\nTo look up the specific training paces for any VDOT value from 30 to 85, I recommend these resources:\n\n1. **Official VDOT Calculator:** VDOT is a measure of your current running ability. Enter a recent or estimated race result to get your VDOT score and current training paces. Each training pace is designed to help you improve your fitness. Visit **[vdoto2.com/calculator](https://vdoto2.com/calculator)**\n\n2. **Jack Daniels' Running Formula (book):** The definitive book on VDOT and scientific training principles includes complete VDOT tables and training plans for all distances.\n\n3. **Sport-Calculator.com** – [sport-calculator.com/calculators/running/jack-daniels-running-calculator](https://sport-calculator.com/calculators/running/jack-daniels-running-calculator)\n\n### Training Distribution\n\nRun 70-80% of your weekly mileage at Easy pace. Limit Threshold, Interval, and Repetition work to 20-30% of total volume.\n\nRecalculate VDOT every 4-8 weeks to adjust training paces as your fitness improves.\n\n### How to Use the Calculators\n\nEnter your race distance and time to calculate your VDOT and training paces. For best results, use a recent all-out race effort from the past 4-6 weeks. Races between 3K and half marathon typically provide the most reliable VDOT estimates. 5K and 10K races are particularly good because they're long enough to measure aerobic capacity but short enough to run at near-maximum effort.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6f74626d-a724-425c-985d-431ff741eb83","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:37:49.660Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"6c213c8b-1714-4195-ac73-669f9e5d20e8"}

Developed by legendary coach Dr. Jack Daniels and exercise physiologist Jimmy Gilbert, the VDOT system is one of the most trusted methods for determining training paces and predicting race times in distance running.\n\n### The VDOT Equation\n\nVDOT is a \"pseudo-VO2max\" calculated from actual race performance. The full formula is:\n\n**VDOT = Oxygen Cost / Fraction of VO₂max**\n\nThe VDOT calculation uses a regression equation relating oxygen cost to velocity and sustainable effort over time:\n\n**VDOT = (−4.60 + 0.182258 × V + 0.000104 × V²) ÷ (0.8 + 0.1894393 × e^(−0.012778 × T) + 0.2989558 × e^(−0.1932605 × T))**\n\nWhere V = velocity in meters per minute, T = time in minutes, e = Euler's number (2.718...)\n\nThe numerator estimates oxygen cost at a given running velocity. The denominator calculates what fraction of your VO2max you can sustain for a given duration—shorter races allow higher fractions.\n\n### The Two Component Equations\n\nThe tables were generated using two regression equations: (1) relating oxygen consumption with velocity, and (2) predicting the amount of time one can run at a given percentage of VO2max.\n\n#### 1. Oxygen Cost (Numerator) — VO₂ as a function of velocity:\n\n**VO₂ = −4.60 + 0.182258 × velocity + 0.000104 × velocity²**\n\nWhere velocity is in **meters per minute**.\n\n**Coefficients:**\n- Constant: **−4.60**\n- Linear coefficient: **0.182258**\n- Quadratic coefficient: **0.000104**\n\n#### 2. Percent of VO₂max Sustained (Denominator) — Fraction of max as a function of time:\n\n**percent_max = 0.8 + 0.1894393 × e^(−0.012778 × time) + 0.2989558 × e^(−0.1932605 × time)**\n\nWhere time is in **minutes**.\n\n**Coefficients:**\n- Constant: **0.8**\n- First exponential amplitude: **0.1894393**\n- First exponential decay rate: **−0.012778**\n- Second exponential amplitude: **0.2989558**\n- Second exponential decay rate: **−0.1932605**\n\n### Solving for Target Pace\n\nAssuming some target paces are at a fixed percentage of VDOT, we can substitute PERCENT_MAX, and solve the equations for T, yielding a general Excel formula, based on DIST, VDOT, and PERCENT_MAX. Once you have the \"vo2max\", and the desired percentage, you can solve the above equations for velocity and/or time, and then figure out the desired pace.\n\n### What VDOT Represents\n\nVDOT is an adjusted VO2 max which gives you a value that can be used to determine your training paces. It takes into account not only your VO2 max but also how efficiently you are able to use the oxygen you consume to determine how fast you could race. This is calculated by taking the calculated VO2 cost of any average race speed and dividing it by the fraction of VO2 max used.\n\n### Source\n\nThe formula comes from: Daniels, Jack, and Jimmy Gilbert. *Oxygen Power: Performance Tables for Distance Runners.* 1979. Also detailed in: Daniels, Jack. *Daniels' Running Formula, 2nd Edition.* Human Kinetics.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"f0050794-ff59-4cc2-9d86-9501d9e352e1","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:38:20.325Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"a02657b7-f9ca-4426-9026-2e604d432a14"}

C. Nielsen Co. He used a number of times of world-level athletes from 400m to 50 miles in a **non-linear regression model** to predict race times.\n\nMore specifically:\n\n- This model is based on the top 10 times in the world at each distance, using them to compute comparable performances across distances.\n\n- Dave Cameron found that doing a regression comparing times and distance was futile; but that a model to predict **speed** (rather than time directly) produced a good formula which worked well for world records, US national records, and collegiate records.\n\n- This model uses the top 10 times in the world at various distances to compute performances across distances. The Cameron formula is calculated by using a non-linear regression method.\n\n### Accuracy and Range\n\n- He found that the model does well for post-1945 records at the 800m through the 10,000m; and that from 1964 it also worked well for the marathon.\n\n- The factor f(D₁)/f(D₂) has the effect of making your time increase by a slightly larger factor than the increase in distance. Equivalently, it makes your time decrease by a slightly smaller factor than the decrease in distance.\n\n### Key Insight on the Coefficients\n\nThe specific coefficients (13.49681, 0.000030363, 835.7114, and 0.7905) were derived through non-linear regression fitted to elite-level world performances. Cameron's key insight was that modeling **speed** as a function of distance — rather than time as a function of distance — produced a much better fit. The function f(x) essentially represents a speed adjustment factor that accounts for the nonlinear decline in average speed as race distance increases.\n\nNote that some sources present the formula with distances in miles rather than meters, which changes the coefficient values. When distances are in miles, the coefficients appear as: a = 13.49681 − 0.048865·dist + 2.438936/(dist^0.7905). When distances are in meters, they appear as: a = 13.49681 − (0.000030363 × dist) + (835.7114 / (dist^0.7905)).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"911c8bb2-f101-4079-b7b9-6801bdd7f0ef","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:38:21.245Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"2d1708d3-b022-4ead-8ce8-2f260f67b77a"}

Multi-Model Prediction Approaches\n\nInstead of relying on one formula, one developer built \"a trio of models to create a cloud of predictions, then refined them into a clear, reliable signal.\" This Strava-based tool emphasizes that single times can lie, so it's better to give a range with a confidence score. Coaches can spot weak distances, and runners can plan smarter using this multi-model approach.\n\nA novel approach published in PMC introduces a generalized method for predicting running performance, designed to apply across a wide range of race distances (from marathons to ultras), elevation gains, and runner types (front-pack to back of the pack).\n\n### 2. Quantifying Uncertainty with Confidence/Credible Intervals\n\nA Carnegie Mellon research paper specifically addresses uncertainty in marathon predictions. Both Bayesian linear regression and quantile linear regression can be used to address the issues present from the traditional method of estimating marathon finish times. The traditional approach has two key weaknesses: runners slow in the second half due to accumulated fatigue, causing the traditional method to underestimate finish time, and the prediction is a single point estimate with no additional information about the uncertainty behind the estimate.\n\nIntuitively, we should feel more confident about a prediction made when a runner has completed 30km (~75%) rather than at 10km (~25%). Predictions can reflect this uncertainty with a range of possible finish times, which should be narrower as the runner gets closer to the finish.\n\nThe models provide credible intervals (50%, 80%, and 95%) at each stage of the race. The proportions of intervals containing the true value are roughly around the expected proportions of 50%, 80%, and 95%, but do not match up perfectly.\n\n### 3. Real-Time Prediction Models for Trail Running\n\nA 2025 study presents a real-time predictive model for marathon and ultra-trail races, analyzing 947 runners from the 'Trail Valle de Tena' event (Spain) to develop equations that estimate total race time using only the first third of the race. The model incorporates weighted time (WTn), pacing variability (WTVn,n+2), and checkpoint percentile rank (CPRn), showing strong predictive power (adjusted R² > 0.95) across sexes and race modalities.\n\n### 4. Practical Coaching Applications\n\nFor trail running coaches, the model suggests: first, recognizing that final race time is largely determined by the runner's ability to sustain high uphill speed; second, training programs should target both uphill performance and fatigue resistance; third, race plans should account for progressive speed loss during ascents, even among elite runners.\n\nThe variables proposed offer practical value as accessible, non-laboratory-based predictors. Their use enables athletes and coaches to monitor race progression and adjust pacing strategies in real time, without the need for prior testing or specialized equipment.\n\nConfidence intervals can be used in a variety of contexts, whether for a coach informing a runner mid-race that they are on-pace for their goal, a spectator assessing when their friend will cross the finish line, or a runner analyzing post-race performance.\n\n### 5. Peer-Based Confidence & Personalized Recommendations\n\nA peer-set analysis can offer a confidence interval for the runner's future marathon time as well as a suitable range for the training features tracked by runners who achieve a finish-time similar to their goal. This factual explanation may improve the user's trust, since they can see exactly how similar they are to their nearest neighbours driving their prediction.\n\nCase-based reasoning (CBR) approaches have proven useful for marathon performance prediction, and researchers have also used techniques such as reinforcement learning and particle swarm optimization to generate and adapt personalised training plans.\n\n### 6. Traditional Approaches & Their Limitations\n\nThe Riegel formula, published by Peter Riegel in 1977, models the relationship between race distance and time as a power law: T2 = T1 × (D2/D1)^1.06. However, predictions are most accurate when your input race is recent (within 4–6 weeks) and was an all-out effort, and predictions work best when the target distance is within 2–4x of your input distance.\n\nThe popularity of long-distance running has generated great interest among coaches and athletes in developing performance prediction models based on linear regression equations, aiming to help athletes in their preparation for competitions. Race time prediction has an initial application for novice runners who have little knowledge of their race paces, allowing them to adjust to constant paces.\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Combining multiple models** (ensemble/trio approaches) produces more reliable predictions than any single formula\n- **Confidence intervals** are essential — they quantify uncertainty and narrow as more race data becomes available\n- **Bayesian and quantile regression** outperform traditional linear extrapolation methods\n- **Practical coaching value** includes real-time pacing adjustments, identifying training weaknesses, and setting realistic race goals with appropriate uncertainty ranges\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6ddccee2-7ed2-4011-a01e-4a4c389434c2","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:38:41.005Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"40892218-d6fe-4678-9c8e-d3780ef50b0d"}

Riegel called this his \"endurance equation.\"\n\nPeter Riegel, an engineer and runner, first published his formula in Runner's World magazine. Research has shown that the exponent 1.06 works well for most recreational and competitive runners, though elite athletes may have slightly different values based on their exceptional training and physiology.\n\n### The Fatigue Factor (F)\n\nThe reciprocal of the endurance parameter, F = 1/E > 1, was termed the \"fatigue factor\" by Riegel (1981). Riegel (1981) also gave values for F in different sports and different demographic groups, derived from world-record performances across different athletes — though these may not be optimal for individual athletes.\n\nThe exponent is called the \"fatigue factor\" since it determines the degree to which a runner slows down as distance increases.\n\n### Variation in the Exponent (1.01 to ~1.15)\n\nThe fatigue factor values range from 1.01 for Nordic skiing to 1.14 for roller skating. Values for running range from 1.05 to 1.08 depending on age group and gender.\n\nSome sites have modified the formula, stating that the value of 1.06 given for the exponent b results in seemingly unachievable predictions for longer distances.\n\nThe endurance parameter E (equivalently, the fatigue factor F) is likely to be different for different athletes. Indeed, if it were not, some athletes would simultaneously hold world records over both short and long race distances. Hence, setting E to a default value incurs a bias, but this bias is outweighed by the variance reductions from avoiding the need to estimate E from limited data. Thus, fixing the fatigue factor to a sensible default value can be justified as a bias–variance trade-off.\n\n### Power Law vs. Critical Power (Hyperbolic) Models\n\nThe power–duration relationship is more adequately represented by an alternative, power-law model. The often-observed good fit of the hyperbolic model between 2 and 15 minutes should not be taken as proof that the power–duration relationship is hyperbolic.\n\nThe power-law (a.k.a. Riegel) model implies a power–duration curve that naturally shifts downwards as the athlete becomes more fatigued without any additional modelling efforts.\n\nThe power-law model is a safer tool for pace selection than the hyperbolic model, and the former more naturally models fatigue than the latter.\n\nThe finding that the power–duration relationship is more adequately modelled by a power law than a hyperbolic function has already been demonstrated in running and swimming. Even in cycling, it has been suggested that \"the power law is better than the critical-power model for predicting cycling endurance performance across a wider range of exercise intensities.\"\n\n### Practical Applications\n\nOld-school runners will recognize this equation as the \"Riegel model,\" which was popularized in the late '70s and early '80s for predicting running performance (often with F fixed at 1.06) and still crops up from time to time online.\n\nFor reasonably accurate race performance prediction, a power law helps. Coaches have seen much more \"sensible\" marathon predictions coming out of power law because inputting data from at least 3 race performances across 5K, 10K, and 21.1K yields a fatigue factor individual to that runner and a conservative marathon prediction. It fills a gap that the critical speed model cannot.\n\n### Key Sources\n- **Published research**: The paper \"Modelling human endurance: power laws vs critical power\" in the *European Journal of Applied Physiology* (2023) provides extensive analysis comparing power-law and hyperbolic models.\n- **bioRxiv preprint** of the same paper (2022) at biorxiv.org\n- **Running Writings** blog analysis (2024) comparing critical speed and power law approaches\n- **Ron George's blog** on updated fatigue factors for women's road racing\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"78b19a43-27d7-47f3-bef9-750fc48b1c12","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:39:20.042Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"5bbbaca0-6570-488d-8ee3-0707d254deff"}

This is one of the simplest approaches, though the main limitation of these approaches is that they do not account for the steepness of the slope, and estimates become highly inaccurate for steep inclines or declines.\n\n### D.B. Dill's Oxygen Cost Formula\nThe core calculation used by some GAP calculators is based on research by D. B. Dill, who determined that the cost associated with the vertical component of running uphill is 1.31 millilitres of oxygen for every metre climbed per kilogram of weight. This value holds true unless you're running very steep gradients.\n\nIf we take the elevation of the run and assume the requirement of 1.31 ml of oxygen per kilogram, we can calculate the oxygen requirements for the climbing component. The reduced effort needed for the downhill component is also considered — downhill running yields a speed increase of roughly 55% of the speed decrease suffered from uphill running.\n\n### RunMotion's Equivalent Distance Formula\nThe flat equivalent pace formula is: **Flat equivalent pace = (Distance + k1 × positive elevation gain – k2 × negative elevation gain) / time**, with k1 and k2 as correcting coefficients. If you go uphill, it's as if the flat distance was greater than the actual distance, and vice versa for downhill. k1 and k2 depend on the slope and are not equal, since you do not make up for the lost time uphill.\n\n### Energy Cost Per Grade\nFor uphill running, for every 1% increase in grade, your energy expenditure increases by approximately 3–4%. This means a 5% grade requires about 15–20% more energy than flat running.\n\n### Minetti Model\nOne of the best-known models is the formula proposed by Professor Minetti in 2002, which explores the relationship between energy expenditure and ground slope, providing a method to calculate the optimal speed for inclined terrains. However, Minetti's model is complex and requires detailed data on ground conditions.\n\n### Simple Empirical Rules\nSome web forums and users' own data suggest that a simple calculation of roughly 50 feet of elevation change adjusts GAP by ~10 seconds, though this would only work for making adjustments at that one runner's pace, since Strava's modeling takes into account the base pace of the run before making a modification.\n\nGenerally, each 100m of elevation gain adds 1–2 minutes to your 5K time, depending on the steepness.\n\n### Key Asymmetry: Uphills vs. Downhills\nRunning up a 10% grade can slow you down by 45%, but running down a 10% grade only speeds you up by about 13%. The negative impact of uphills is much greater than the benefit of downhills.\n\n### Limitations\nBoth the Minetti and Black datasets were collected on treadmills. Real trail, ultra, mountain, skyrunning, and fell races have very rough terrain that can increase the metabolic cost of running compared to an equivalent incline with good footing. Likewise, the downhills in these events are also very technical, making it hard to take full advantage of downhill energetic savings. So, GAP predictions will be too optimistic for very rough terrain.\n\nGAP calculations are based on average physiological responses and work well for most runners. However, individual variations exist — some runners are naturally better hill climbers or have more efficient downhill technique. Over time, you'll learn how your personal response compares to GAP predictions.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"3b2bcbc3-3807-454b-afa0-f271664faa62","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:39:21.478Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"ee556ff8-f7ef-4125-9bbd-328ea714c29e"}

Tweaking these models showed little gains relative to improving the data with some feature engineering, such as extrapolating heart rate from pace where heart rate data wasn't present.\n\n- One project explored machine learning and regression models for predicting marathon race times based on Boston historical races, using 4 years (2015–2018) of data narrowed down to \"legacy runners\" (repeat runners) fed into various models using linear regression and stochastic gradient descent.\n\n### Training Data from Strava and Wearables\n\n- There are two main sources of data used: individual activity sessions from Strava and marathon race records from big-city marathons. Strava is a popular exercise app used by millions of runners and cyclists worldwide. As part of an ongoing data-sharing agreement, Strava has made available a large subset of anonymised running data for research purposes.\n\n- One study used real-world data from approximately 300,000 recreational Strava runners who trained for 500,000 unique marathons between 2014–2017.\n\n- The raw data from Strava is made up of individual activities for users, each associated with time series capturing distance, time, and elevation. Distance and time are converted into pace (mins/km), and elevation data is used to produce grade-adjusted pacing values (GAP), which adjust paces for elevation/gradient so uphill paces appear faster and downhill paces slower.\n\n### Strava's Own ML-Powered Performance Predictions\n\n- Strava's Performance Prediction feature is powered by an ML model that leverages over 100 athlete data attributes, including all-time run history and top performances. Unlike other race predictors that rely on theoretical inputs like estimated VO2 max, Strava only uses real activity data to predict race results. The system also leverages athletes' performances with similar training histories, and times for each race distance are calculated independently for greater precision.\n\n- To see predictions, a subscriber must upload at least 20 run activities within a rolling 24-week window. This threshold ensures that the ML model has sufficient data to make high-quality predictions. The model generates a new set of predictions after each run upload, and after three days without any run uploads.\n\n### Comparison with Classical Formulas\n\n- Assuming regular tempo runs and long runs around 25–30km, it is fairly simple to extrapolate marathon time from 5K time using \"vdot,\" a formula developed by legendary running coach Jack Daniels. However, vdot is not a perfect synonym of fitness—it's more a measure of speed.\n\n- Classical tools rely on plugging in a recent 5K PR and getting a marathon time from a black-box calculator. These tools give a decent ballpark, but they lean on a massive assumption: one run, on one day, sums up your fitness, while hundreds of data points painting a fuller picture are tossed aside for a one-size-fits-all formula.\n\n- Other fitness platforms like Garmin and Polar also offer race-time predictions using data points like pace, VO2 max, and race history. However, Strava's Performance Predictions is powered by machine learning, meaning it continuously updates after each run and adapts to changes in training.\n\n### Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) as an Alternative ML Approach\n\n- CBR methods have proven useful for predicting marathon performance. One reason is the local reasoning used by CBR techniques—predictions for a target runner are based on maximally similar runners (local neighbours) in the feature space, which is appropriate given the noisy nature of running data, including GPS errors and variable effort days.\n\n- CBR allows adding new cases to the system without re-training a complex model, and CBR approaches are more interpretable than the \"black-box\" style reasoning used by some other ML approaches.\n\n### Key Features Used\n\n- All features are stored per personal best, per athlete and used to train the final models. Importantly, pace is NOT used as a feature, as that would be circular when predicting pace.\n\n- In CBR approaches, a case is a representation of a runner for a given week of training in terms of various distance and pacing features.\n\n- Beyond the obvious \"run more\" and \"run more often,\" models identify features like heart rate zone 2 training, hill running, and cross-training as significant predictors.\n\n### Real-World Accuracy Debates\n\n- Some users have noted discrepancies: one runner reported that during marathon training, Garmin predicted a half marathon in 1:45:33 while Strava said 2:03:44. The actual finish was 1:50:43, suggesting Strava's model can sometimes be overly conservative.\n\n- Intuitively, and based on model performance, some researchers have found the marathon prediction problem to be near-linear.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe field is moving from classical single-race-input formulas (like Riegel's formula or VDOT) toward ML models that ingest entire training histories from platforms like Strava. Gradient boosting (XGBoost) and decision trees have shown strong performance, while neural networks and more complex models haven't always provided significant improvement over simpler approaches for this near-linear problem. The richest gains come from better feature engineering and more comprehensive training data rather than model complexity.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"06804677-5c10-40c0-a903-833f910537ce","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:39:37.849Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"095c4cc1-2a17-472f-89de-05c282967199"}

Minetti, Christian Moia, Giulio S. Roi, Davide Susta, and Guido Ferretti, titled \"Energy cost of walking and running at extreme uphill and downhill slopes,\" published in *J Appl Physiol* 93: 1039–1046, 2002.\n\n### Experimental Setup\n\nThe costs of walking (Cw) and running (Cr) were measured on 10 runners on a treadmill inclined between −0.45 to +0.45 at different speeds. The minimum Cw was 1.64 ± 0.50 J·kg⁻¹·m⁻¹ at a 1.0 ± 0.3 m/s speed on the level. It increased on positive slopes, attained 17.33 ± 1.11 J·kg⁻¹·m⁻¹ at +0.45, and was reduced to 0.81 ± 0.37 J·kg⁻¹·m⁻¹ at −0.10. At steeper slopes, it increased to reach 3.46 ± 0.95 J·kg⁻¹·m⁻¹ at −0.45.\n\nCr was 3.40 ± 0.24 J·kg⁻¹·m⁻¹ on the level, independent of speed. It increased on positive slopes, attained 18.93 ± 1.74 J·kg⁻¹·m⁻¹ at +0.45, and was reduced to 1.73 ± 0.36 J·kg⁻¹·m⁻¹ at −0.20. At steeper slopes, it increased to reach 3.92 ± 0.81 J·kg⁻¹·m⁻¹ at −0.45.\n\n### 5th-Order Polynomial Regression\n\nTo accurately describe the relationship between Cw or Cr and the gradient *i* within the investigated range, 5th-order polynomial regressions were performed. The pioneering efforts of Minetti et al. (2002) introduced a 5th order polynomial equation for this purpose.\n\n#### Walking Formula (from citing works)\n\nOne such model is a fifth-order polynomial regression: **E_walk(s) = 280.5s⁵ − 58.7s⁴ − 76.8s³ + 51.9s² + 19.6s + 2.5**, where the numeric figures are least-squares fitted values for the fifth-order polynomial. Units for this formula are E_walk in J/kg·m and *s* is the slope quotient Δy/Δx, which is negative going downhill.\n\n### Grade-Adjusted Speed Parametrizations\n\nTo analyze pacing evolution, the grade-adjusted speed can be calculated following Minetti and colleagues' parametrizations for walking and running. Their parametrizations correspond to best-fitting polynomials of the measured metabolic energy cost as a function of the gradient.\n\n### Earlier Work (1994) — Gradient Running\n\nThere is also an earlier foundational paper:\n\nMinetti, Ardigò, and Saibene published \"Mechanical Determinants of the Minimum Energy Cost of Gradient Running in Humans\" in *J Exp Biol*, October 1994; 195(1): 211–225.\n\nThe metabolic cost and the mechanical work of running at different speeds and gradients were measured on five human subjects. The mechanical work was partitioned into internal work (Wint) and external work (Wext). For all constant speeds, the most economical gradient was −10.6 ± 0.5% with a metabolic cost of 146.8 ± 3.8 ml O₂ kg⁻¹ km⁻¹.\n\nThe metabolic cost C was predicted from mechanical experimental data using efficiencies: eff⁻ (0.80), eff⁺ (0.18), and effi (0.30) for negative external work, positive external work, and internal work respectively, with elastic energy assumed to be 55 J step⁻¹. The predicted C versus gradient curve coincides with the curve obtained from metabolic measurements.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n- The W⁺ext/W⁻ext partitioning and the eff⁺/eff⁻ ratio — i.e., the different efficiency of the muscles during acceleration and braking — explain the metabolic optimum gradient for running of about −10%.\n- The mechanical efficiencies of walking and running above +0.15 and below −0.15 attained those of concentric and eccentric muscular contraction, respectively.\n- Minetti et al. (2002) established that for both walking and running at a given steep incline, up to 24.2° (45%), metabolic power increases linearly with treadmill velocity. Further, they found that at a given treadmill velocity, metabolic power increases linearly with the sine of the incline angle for slopes between 0 and 24.2°.\n\nThese polynomial models are widely used in trail running, mountaineering, and sports science to estimate metabolic cost and compute grade-adjusted pace (GAP) for activities on variable terrain.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6aa9cb45-ba6d-47db-ac6c-e81c5c0d385a","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:40:14.728Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"8d046529-c0b6-404e-a7c6-af21b20d6de5"}

Riegel Formula (Power-Law Model)\n\nThe Riegel formula is the most widely used model, developed by Peter Riegel. The formula is **T₂ = T₁ × (D₂/D₁)^1.06**, where the fatigue exponent (≈1.06) captures the fact that pace slows as races lengthen.\n\n- **Distance Range:** Riegel claims that the formula is most accurate for runs lasting from three and a half minutes to three hours fifty minutes. It uses a fatigue factor of 1.06 and is considered accurate for most runners across a wide range of distances.\n- **Customization:** Riegel's 1.06 exponent is a starting point. Speed-oriented athletes may fit better with 1.03–1.05, while endurance specialists or ultra runners might trend toward 1.07–1.10.\n- **Limitations:** Vickers sees several problems with the Riegel approach. First, it assumes that the relationship between your pace in a 100-meter sprint and a 5K is the same as the ratio between your speed in a mile run and a marathon. Yet we know that natural sprinters will perform relatively better in short races than in longer ones, and vice versa. Additionally, the Riegel and Cameron numbers are based on elite athletes, so they may not work as well for slower runners.\n- **When to Use:** For newer runners or those without specific distance training, Riegel predictions tend to be more realistic.\n\n### 2. VDOT (Jack Daniels' Method)\n\nVDOT (Daniels method) uses your aerobic fitness level based on established equivalent performance tables. It's possible to estimate equivalent performances across different distances by using the formula to convert a time to an estimated VO₂ Max value, and then using that estimated VO₂ Max value to generate predicted times.\n\n- **Distance Range:** Although VO₂ Max may not be a perfect predictor of who will win between any two athletes, it does do a good job of predicting comparable performances for distances over 1500m. Distances shorter than 1500m do not rely on aerobic capacity nearly as much, thus they are better predicted by other models.\n- **Strengths:** It is validated extensively and tested on thousands of runners. It directly links to training zones, and predictions are conservative — achievable, not optimistic.\n- **Limitations:** It assumes aerobic equivalence and doesn't account for pure speed differences. Training specificity matters — a 5K-focused runner may underperform in the marathon. First-time marathoners often miss VDOT predictions.\n- **When to Use:** If you're well-trained with a good endurance base, VDOT predictions may be more accurate. The VDOT system uses your race results to determine appropriate paces for easy runs, tempo runs, and intervals, regardless of whether the race predictions prove accurate.\n\n### 3. Cameron Formula\n\nDave Cameron's Model is based on the top 10 times in the world at each distance, using them to compute comparable performances across distances.\n\n- **Distance Range:** It's claimed to work best for distances from 800m to the marathon. The speed vs. distance model works well for post-1945 records at 800m through 10k. From 1964 onward it also works well for the marathon.\n- **When to Use:** Cameron's model tends to be more accurate for longer distances like marathons and ultramarathons.\n\n---\n\n### How Do They Compare in Practice?\n\nFor a given input, the Pete Riegel formula might predict 2:56:05 for the marathon, McMillan's calculator says 2:55:23, and Jack Daniels' VDOT system projects 2:52:45. That's over three minutes of difference.\n\nRiegel tends to be more conservative for longer distances, while VDOT accounts for training adaptations. For 5K to half marathon predictions, all methods perform similarly. Marathon predictions are inherently less accurate because of the glycogen/fueling variable.\n\nA useful confidence check: If all three methods agree within 2-3%, you have high confidence. If they diverge, investigate why.\n\n---\n\n### Key Practical Tips for Coaches and Runners\n\n1. **Use nearby distances as inputs:** Predictions are more likely to be accurate for distances that are close to the distance entered. For example, marathon time prediction will be more accurate when a half marathon or 10k race time is used. Predictions work best when the target distance is within 2–4x of your input distance.\n\n2. **Use recent results:** Accuracy is best when using recent race times (within 2-3 months) and when predicting similar race types (road to road, trail to trail).\n\n3. **All-out efforts only:** Your input race should be an all-out effort, not a training run or easy race. Training runs without taper or race-day adrenaline often underperform by 1–3%.\n\n4. **Adjust for runner type:** The truth is that race calculators estimate a best-guess, ballpark time based on population averages. McMillan acknowledges: \"If you are a speedster, it will probably be harder for you to hit the predicted time of the longer races.\"\n\n5. **Training volume matters:** A runner maintaining 40 miles per week simply can't achieve the marathon time that a calculator predicts based on their 5K fitness. The calculators show \"equivalent performance,\" not \"what you could run.\"\n\n6. **Use predictors as coaching tools:** Coaches and self-coached runners use predictors for race-distance transitions, season planning, team seeding by predicted marathon pace, and fuel strategy testing.\n\n7. **Use the 10K as a base distance:** The 10K is the best predictor distance because it bridges both qualities (speed and endurance).\n\n8. **Calibrate over time:** The most accurate approach combines calculator predictions with self-knowledge. Run tune-up races at different distances during training. Compare actual performances to predicted times. Adjust future predictions based on where you consistently overperform or underperform.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Model | Best Distance Range | Best For | Key Limitation |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Riegel** | ~3.5 min to ~3:50 race durations | Simple, universal estimates; newer runners | Single exponent for all runners; based on elites |\n| **VDOT (Daniels)** | 1500m to marathon | Well-trained runners; training zone integration | Assumes equivalent training across distances |\n| **Cameron** | 800m to marathon | Longer distances (marathon+) | Based on world-class performances |\n\nRace time prediction is difficult, particularly for the most-common approach, which is to try to derive a single formula to cater for all runners and all distances. This is problematic since runners vary wildly in their ability to convert performances from one event to another. The best approach is to use multiple models, compare their outputs, and calibrate against your own race history.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b1891297-f0ae-451c-bff4-af179bfc652b","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:40:41.319Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"52f5783e-5ff2-4674-bb16-3c9e3d1fdc71"}

Easy running is a comfortable, conversational pace, which may vary daily depending on how you are feeling, and the weather and terrain. Running at your Easy pace promotes physiological benefits that build a solid base from which higher-intensity training can be performed.\n\n### 2. **Marathon (M) Pace** — 75–84% of VO2max\nGenerally in the range 75–84% of VO2max or 80–90% of your HRmax. Used to experience race pace conditions for those training for a marathon or simply as an alternative to Easy pace running for beginners on long run days. On the official VDOT O2 site, marathon pace is typically at an intensity that is felt to be about 75–85% effort.\n\n### 3. **Threshold (T) Pace** — 83–88% of VO2max\nGenerally in the range of 83–88% of VO2max or 88–92% of HRmax. Threshold pace is comfortably hard running for either a steady 3–4 miles (or 5 to 6km) or repeated runs of 5 to 15 minutes each, with 1 to 3 minutes of rest between the runs. Purpose: To improve endurance.\n\n### 4. **Interval (I) Pace** — 95–100% of VO2max\nGenerally in the range of 95–100% of VO2max or 98–100% of HRmax. Some sources refine this slightly: generally, in the range of 97–100% of VO2max or 98–100% of HRmax. Intervals are \"hard,\" but not all-out running by any means. Intervals are similar to a pace that you could maintain for about 10–12 minutes in a serious race. Purpose: Stress your aerobic power (VO2max).\n\n### 5. **Repetition (R) Pace** — Faster than VO2max pace\nReps are fast, but not necessarily \"hard,\" because workbouts are relatively short and are followed by relatively long recoveries. Purpose: To improve speed, stress anaerobic power, and learn the feeling of 800-meter race pace. Repetition pace is not typically expressed as a fixed VO2max percentage since this will vary based on the distance that you are training for and is therefore not associated with heart rate max often.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Zone | % of VO2max | % of HRmax | Purpose |\n|------|------------|------------|---------|\n| **Easy (E)** | 59–74% | 65–79% | Aerobic base, recovery |\n| **Marathon (M)** | 75–84% | 80–90% | Race-specific endurance |\n| **Threshold (T)** | 83–88% | 88–92% | Lactate threshold improvement |\n| **Interval (I)** | 95–100% | 98–100% | VO2max development |\n| **Repetition (R)** | >100% | N/A | Speed & running economy |\n\n---\n\n## Key Notes\n\n- VDOT is a running performance index that represents your current running fitness level. It combines both your aerobic capacity (VO2max) and running economy into a single score.\n- The denominator of the Daniels-Gilbert formula calculates what fraction of your VO2max you can sustain for a given duration—shorter races allow higher percentages.\n- Training distribution should be 70–80% of your weekly mileage at Easy pace, with quality sessions (Threshold, Interval, and Repetition work) limited to 20–30% of total volume.\n- Do not equate VDOT to VO2max.

Twenty-two runners, aged 28–54 years, participated, keeping daily exercise records during training for 46 races with marathon times ranging from 167 to 216 minutes. MPT was found to be primarily affected by mean distance run per week (K) and mean training pace (P), combined into a predictive formula for mean marathon pace Pm (sec/km) = 17.1 + 140·exp(−0.0053·K) + 0.55·P.\n\n### Coefficients C1, C2, C3, C4\nThe formula is based on two independent variables (the training indices K and P) and four empirical constants (C1, C2, C3, C4) whose values were optimised on the basis of the original sample database. For marathoners with MPT in the range 2:47–3:36 (hour:min), the values appear to be independent of the subjects (and gender): **C1 = 17.1, C2 = 140.0, C3 = 0.0053, C4 = 0.55**.\n\nAmong these constants, C1 is an offset value, C2 and C3 rule the relationship between race pace and weekly distance, while C4 is related to the dependence of race pace on training pace.\n\n### 2022 Validation Study – General Applicability\nThe key follow-up paper by Tanda was published in the *Journal of Human Sport and Exercise* (2022):\n\n> Published April 01, 2022 (in press September 28, 2020), as: Tanda, G. (2022). \"A simple relationship for predicting marathon performance from training: Is it generally applicable?\" *Journal of Human Sport and Exercise*, 17(2), 293-301.\n\n### Key Findings on Wider Applicability\n\n1. **Robust for mid-range runners:** The predictive formula, even though outlined on the basis of a limited sample group (but with very accurate training data), has been proved to be robust and consistent with a new author's database and with a database extracted from Strava for marathoners (75% males, 25% females) having a MPT falling in the validity range of correlation: MPT = 2:47–3:36 (hour:min).\n\n2. **Concerns for faster runners:** The processing of Strava data for 90 athletes with MPT < 2:47 (hour:min) poses some concerns. This was accomplished by extracting from Strava data for 90 athletes with MPT in the range 2:14–2:47 (hour:min). Figure 2 shows the predicted versus measured marathon paces for the author's new database (No.2) and the entire Strava sample groups.\n\n3. **Why the formula may underperform for faster runners:** The relationship between race pace and mean distance run per week is only slightly affected by the athlete performance (i.e., C2 and C3 are likely to be independent of individual characteristics), while faster runners seem to train at a mean pace markedly higher than that calculated for the original author's database (modelled on slower runners).\n\n4. **The role of C4:** The value of constant C4 reflects the effect of training pace directly on the predicted race pace. If a subject is able to run the marathon faster than prediction, probably its \"personal\" C4 is lower than the \"universal\" value (C4 = 0.55) adopted in the formula.\n\n5. **Potential for tailoring:** Adjusting constants C1 and/or C4 to take into account the pacing strategy (i.e., polarized training effect) is a demanding task since probably a huge amount of training data is required. However, this does not refute, in the author's opinion, the possibility, even for faster runners, to relate marathon performance to K and P training indices by properly tailoring one or two constants.\n\n### Practical Accuracy\nThe formula works rather well (roughly five minutes accuracy) and predicts reasonably for both ends of the ability spectrum. The formula predicts marathon performance based solely on how far and how fast you have run over the eight weeks ending one week before the marathon.\n\n### Comparison with Other Models\nSome studies reported R² values similar to those of the Tanda regression models (R² = 0.72 for Tanda's model and R² = 0.81 for Tanda and Knechtle's model vs. R² = 0.87–0.91 for alternative models). However, compared to those models, some proposals require monitoring of specific training and physiological variables that the majority of recreational runners do not conduct, making them more difficult to apply.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe Tanda formula remains a remarkably simple and practical marathon prediction tool. The 2022 validation study confirmed that the four coefficients (C1=17.1, C2=140.0, C3=0.0053, C4=0.55) are robust and gender-independent for runners finishing between approximately **2:47 and 3:36**. For faster marathoners (sub-2:47), the formula tends to overestimate race pace, primarily because faster athletes use more polarized training approaches that change the effective value of C4. The author suggests that personalized adjustment of C1 and/or C4 could extend the formula's applicability to elite runners.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"774e7e97-3fe7-45ba-b4dc-be8cccc71b65","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:42:00.335Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"0a49748d-b3a4-4653-a74e-6418c8e45326"}

Riegel Formula\n\n### The Formula\n\n```\nT2 = T1 * (D2 / D1) ^ 1.06\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `T1` = known race time\n- `D1` = known race distance\n- `D2` = target race distance\n- `T2` = predicted race time\n- `1.06` = the fatigue factor (endurance exponent)\n\n**Interpretation:** Doubling the distance increases time by a factor of approximately `2^1.06 = 2.084` (not just 2x), capturing the nonlinear slowdown as distance increases.\n\n### Origin\n\nPublished by Peter Riegel in *Runner's World* magazine in 1977 and formalized in a 1981 paper. Riegel was an American research engineer and marathoner. The formula models the power-law relationship between race distance and time.\n\n### The Fatigue Factor Exponent\n\nThe 1.06 exponent is the population average. Research and coaching experience show it varies by runner profile:\n\n| Runner Type | Exponent Range | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Speed-oriented / sprinters | 1.03 - 1.05 | Less pace degradation with distance |\n| Average recreational runner | 1.06 | Riegel's default |\n| Endurance-oriented runner | 1.07 - 1.08 | Standard for strong endurance runners |\n| Ultramarathon runners | 1.08 - 1.15 | Greater fatigue effect over extreme distances |\n| Nordic skiing | ~1.01 | Lowest across sports |\n| Roller skating | ~1.14 | Highest across sports |\n\n**Personalization method:** If a runner has race results at two different distances, solve for the exponent: `exponent = ln(T2/T1) / ln(D2/D1)`. This personal fatigue factor is more accurate than the default 1.06.\n\n### Valid Range\n\n- **Duration:** 3.5 minutes to ~230 minutes (1500m to marathon)\n- **Best accuracy:** When input and target distances are within 2-4x of each other\n- **Degrades:** For very short races (<3.5 min) and very long races (>4 hours)\n\n### Assumptions and Limitations\n\n1. **Assumes equivalent training** for both distances. A 5K-fit runner on 40 miles/week cannot achieve the predicted marathon time.\n2. **Assumes all-out effort** for the input race. Training runs will produce overly slow predictions.\n3. **Single exponent for all runners** introduces bias. Natural sprinters will underperform at long distances relative to prediction; natural endurance athletes will outperform.\n4. **Based on elite performance data.** May be less accurate for slower recreational runners.\n5. **Does not account for** fueling, glycogen depletion, or environmental conditions.\n6. **Marathon predictions from 5K** are notoriously optimistic for undertrained runners.\n\n### Scientific Context\n\nA 2023 paper in the *European Journal of Applied Physiology* (\"Modelling human endurance: power laws vs critical power\") confirmed that the power-law model (Riegel's approach) is more adequate than the hyperbolic/critical-power model for representing the power-duration relationship across a wide range of durations. The power-law model naturally models fatigue without additional corrections and is considered a safer tool for pace selection.\n\n### Sources\n- [About Riegel's Formula - PredictMyRun](https://www.predictmyrun.com/about)\n- [Riegel's Formula - TrainAsONE](https://trainasone.com/ufaq/riegels-formula/)\n- [Peter Riegel - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Riegel)\n- [Modelling human endurance: power laws vs critical power (PMC)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10858092/)\n- [Running Writings - Power Laws](https://runningwritings.com/2024/01/problems-with-critical-speed-and-power-laws.html)\n- [Race Calculator Accuracy - Runners Connect](https://runnersconnect.net/race-calculators/)\n- [Riegel Calculator - had2know.org](https://www.had2know.org/sports/running-time-prediction-calculator-riegel.html)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Cameron Model\n\n### The Formula\n\n```\nT2 = T1 * (D2 / D1) * (f(D1) / f(D2))\n```\n\nWhere `f(x)` is a speed-adjustment function defined as:\n\n**With distances in meters:**\n```\nf(x) = 13.49681 - 0.000030363 * x + 835.7114 / (x ^ 0.7905)\n```\n\n**With distances in miles:**\n```\nf(x) = 13.49681 - 0.048865 * x + 2.438936 / (x ^ 0.7905)\n```\n\n### Coefficients\n\n| Coefficient | Value | Role |\n|---|---|---|\n| Constant | 13.49681 | Asymptotic speed factor |\n| Linear term | -0.000030363 (meters) / -0.048865 (miles) | Distance-dependent speed decay |\n| Power term numerator | 835.7114 (meters) / 2.438936 (miles) | Short-distance speed boost |\n| Power term exponent | 0.7905 | Rate of short-distance advantage |\n\n### Derivation\n\nDeveloped by Dave Cameron (1998) for Statistical Services of A.C. Nielsen Co. using **non-linear regression** on the top 10 world-level performances from 400m to 50 miles. Cameron's key insight was modeling **speed** as a function of distance rather than time as a function of distance, which produced a much better fit.\n\n### How It Differs from Riegel\n\n| Aspect | Riegel | Cameron |\n|---|---|---|\n| Approach | Single power-law exponent | Non-linear regression on speed vs. distance |\n| Basis | Population average fatigue factor | World-record performances at each distance |\n| Function form | Simple power law | Rational function with 4 coefficients |\n| Distance range | 1500m - marathon | 800m - 50 miles |\n| Long-distance predictions | Slightly more conservative | Slightly faster (more optimistic) |\n| Customization | Can adjust exponent per runner | Fixed coefficients |\n\n### Accuracy Profile\n\n- Works well for post-1945 records at 800m through 10K\n- Works well for marathon records from 1964 onward\n- Tends to produce slightly faster marathon predictions than Riegel\n- Often more accurate for elite runners (since derived from world-class data)\n- Does not account for age, sex, or training volume\n\n### Sources\n- [Cameron Formula Calculator - had2know.org](https://www.had2know.org/sports/race-performance-prediction-calculator-cameron.html)\n- [General Race Predictors - RunBundle](https://runbundle.com/tools/race-predictors/general-race-predictors)\n- [FAQ: Race time predictor - chatnrun.nl](https://www.chatnrun.nl/calculator/faq/rp.php)\n- [Run-Down Statistics - Performance Predictors](https://run-down.com/statistics/calcs_explained.php)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Tanda Marathon Prediction\n\n### The Formula\n\n```\nPm = 17.1 + 140.0 * exp(-0.0053 * K) + 0.55 * P\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `Pm` = predicted marathon pace (seconds per km)\n- `K` = mean weekly training distance (km/week) over the 8-week window\n- `P` = mean training pace (seconds per km) over the 8-week window\n\n**To get marathon finish time:** `Finish_time = Pm * 42.195`\n\n### Coefficients Explained\n\n| Constant | Value | Role |\n|---|---|---|\n| C1 | 17.1 | Base offset (sec/km) -- irreducible minimum pace |\n| C2 | 140.0 | Amplitude of mileage effect |\n| C3 | 0.0053 | Decay rate of mileage benefit (diminishing returns) |\n| C4 | 0.55 | Training pace multiplier (how much faster training -> faster race) |\n\n**How each component works:**\n- **C1 (17.1):** Fixed baseline. Even with infinite mileage and zero training pace, you cannot go faster than 17.1 sec/km (~4:33/mile pace).\n- **C2 * exp(-C3 * K):** The exponential term captures diminishing returns of weekly mileage. At K=0 km/week, this adds 140 sec/km. At K=100 km/week, it adds ~82 sec/km. At K=200 km/week, ~48 sec/km.\n- **C4 * P:** Linear relationship between training pace and race pace. Every 1 sec/km faster in training yields 0.55 sec/km faster in the marathon.\n\n### Data Requirements\n\n- **Training window:** 8 weeks of training data, ending 1 week before the marathon (i.e., weeks 9 through 2 before race day, excluding taper week)\n- **Required inputs:** Daily distance and pace for each training run\n- **Compute:** Mean weekly distance K (km/week) and mean training pace P (sec/km) across the 8-week window\n\n### Accuracy\n\n- **Standard error of estimate (SEE):** ~4 minutes for runners in the original validation range\n- **R-squared:** 0.72 (Tanda's original); 0.81 (Tanda & Knechtle extended model)\n- **Validated range:** Marathon finish times of 2:47 to 3:36\n- **Gender-independent:** The four coefficients are the same for men and women within the validated range\n\n### Limitations and Adjustments\n\n1. **Range limitations:** Fitted on 22 runners (46 marathons, 2:47-3:36 finish). Less accurate outside this range.\n2. **For faster runners (sub-2:47):** The formula tends to overestimate pace (predict slower times). Faster athletes often use polarized training, making C4 effectively lower than 0.55. Personal calibration of C4 may be needed.\n3. **For slower runners (>3:36):** Less validated, but the exponential structure should still capture the mileage-performance relationship.\n4. **BMI assumption:** Original subjects had BMI < 25. Runners with higher BMI may see reduced accuracy.\n5. **Does not account for:** terrain, weather, race strategy, fueling, mental state, or injuries/training interruptions.\n6. **Assumes consistent training:** Irregular training patterns reduce accuracy.\n\n### 2022 Validation Study\n\nTanda's 2022 follow-up paper (\"A simple relationship for predicting marathon performance from training: Is it generally applicable?\" *Journal of Human Sport and Exercise*, 17(2), 293-301) confirmed:\n- C2 and C3 (mileage coefficients) are independent of individual characteristics\n- C4 (pace coefficient) may need personalization for elite athletes\n- The formula is robust and consistent with Strava data for runners in the 2:47-3:36 range\n- For 90 athletes with MPT 2:14-2:47, the formula showed some concerns (tended to overpredict pace)\n\n### Sources\n- [Tanda Original Paper (ResearchGate)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262686102_Prediction_of_marathon_performance_time_on_the_basis_of_training_indices)\n- [Tanda 2022 Validation (ResearchGate)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346908023_A_simple_relationship_for_predicting_marathon_performance_from_training_Is_it_generally_applicable)\n- [Tanda Race Predictor Tool](https://tandaracepredictor.com/)\n- [Tanda Marathon Predictor - Running Universe](https://running-universe.com/predicting-marathon-finish-times-the-tanda-equation/)\n- [Fetcheveryone Tanda Calculator](https://www.fetcheveryone.com/training-calculators-tanda.php)\n\n---\n\n## 4. VDOT (Jack Daniels)\n\n### What VDOT Is\n\nVDOT is a \"pseudo-VO2max\" score developed by Dr. Jack Daniels and Jimmy Gilbert that combines aerobic capacity (VO2max) and running economy into a single performance index. Unlike lab-based VO2max testing, VDOT is calculated from actual race performance.\n\n### The Daniels-Gilbert Formula\n\n**VDOT = VO2_cost / fraction_VO2max**\n\n#### Numerator: Oxygen Cost of Running\n\n```\nVO2 = -4.60 + 0.182258 * v + 0.000104 * v^2\n```\n\nWhere `v` = velocity in **meters per minute**.\n\n| Coefficient | Value | Unit |\n|---|---|---|\n| Constant | -4.60 | ml O2/kg/min |\n| Linear | 0.182258 | ml O2/kg/min per m/min |\n| Quadratic | 0.000104 | ml O2/kg/min per (m/min)^2 |\n\n#### Denominator: Fraction of VO2max Sustainable Over Time\n\n```\n%VO2max = 0.8 + 0.1894393 * e^(-0.012778 * t) + 0.2989558 * e^(-0.1932605 * t)\n```\n\nWhere `t` = race duration in **minutes**.\n\n| Coefficient | Value | Role |\n|---|---|---|\n| Asymptote | 0.8 | Long-duration limit (~80% VO2max) |\n| Amplitude 1 | 0.1894393 | Slow decay component |\n| Decay rate 1 | 0.012778 | Slow exponential rate (min^-1) |\n| Amplitude 2 | 0.2989558 | Fast decay component |\n| Decay rate 2 | 0.1932605 | Fast exponential rate (min^-1) |\n\n**Behavior:**\n- At t=0 (instantaneous): %VO2max = 0.8 + 0.189 + 0.299 = ~1.288 (>100%, accounting for anaerobic contribution)\n- At t=4 min: ~1.0 (100% VO2max sustainable for ~4 min)\n- At t=10 min: ~0.96\n- At t=30 min: ~0.90\n- At t=60 min: ~0.86\n- At t=120 min: ~0.83\n- At t=240 min: ~0.81\n- As t->infinity: approaches 0.80\n\n### Computing VDOT from a Race Result\n\n```python\n# Given: race_distance (meters), race_time (minutes)\nvelocity = race_distance / race_time  # meters per minute\nvo2_cost = -4.60 + 0.182258 * velocity + 0.000104 * velocity**2\npct_max = 0.8 + 0.1894393 * math.exp(-0.012778 * race_time) + 0.2989558 * math.exp(-0.1932605 * race_time)\nvdot = vo2_cost / pct_max\n```\n\n### Predicting Race Times from VDOT\n\nTo predict a time at a new distance, you need to find the time `t` such that:\n```\nVDOT = (-4.60 + 0.182258 * (D/t) + 0.000104 * (D/t)^2) / (0.8 + 0.1894393 * e^(-0.012778*t) + 0.2989558 * e^(-0.1932605*t))\n```\n\nThis requires numerical solving (Newton's method or binary search) since time appears in both numerator and denominator.\n\n### Training Pace Zones\n\nEach zone is defined as a percentage of VO2max, which maps to a velocity via the oxygen cost equation:\n\n| Zone | % of VO2max | % of HRmax | Purpose | Typical Duration |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Easy (E)** | 59-74% | 65-79% | Aerobic base, recovery | Continuous |\n| **Marathon (M)** | 75-84% | 80-90% | Marathon-specific endurance | 40-110 min |\n| **Threshold (T)** | 83-88% | 88-92% | Lactate threshold improvement | 20-40 min total |\n| **Interval (I)** | 95-100% | 98-100% | VO2max development | 3-5 min bouts |\n| **Repetition (R)** | >100% | N/A | Speed & running economy | 30s-2 min bouts |\n\n**To compute a training pace from VDOT:**\n1. Multiply VDOT by the target %VO2max (e.g., 0.86 for Threshold)\n2. Solve the oxygen cost equation for velocity: `target_VO2 = -4.60 + 0.182258*v + 0.000104*v^2`\n3. Use the quadratic formula to find `v` (meters/min), then convert to pace\n\n### Sample VDOT Reference Points\n\n| VDOT | 5K Time | 10K Time | Half Marathon | Marathon | Easy Pace (min/mi) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 30 | 30:40 | 63:46 | 2:21:04 | 4:49:17 | 13:00-14:00 |\n| 35 | 27:00 | 56:05 | 2:04:13 | 4:16:13 | 11:30-12:24 |\n| 40 | 24:08 | 50:03 | 1:50:59 | 3:49:45 | 10:18-11:06 |\n| 45 | 21:50 | 45:16 | 1:40:20 | 3:28:26 | 9:18-10:00 |\n| 50 | 19:57 | 41:21 | 1:31:35 | 3:10:49 | 8:30-9:08 |\n| 55 | 18:22 | 38:03 | 1:24:16 | 2:56:01 | 7:48-8:24 |\n| 60 | 17:03 | 35:22 | 1:18:09 | 2:43:25 | 7:18-7:48 |\n| 65 | 15:54 | 33:01 | 1:12:53 | 2:32:35 | 6:48-7:18 |\n| 70 | 14:55 | 30:58 | 1:08:19 | 2:23:10 | 6:24-6:54 |\n| 75 | 14:03 | 29:09 | 1:04:16 | 2:14:55 | 6:00-6:30 |\n| 80 | 13:16 | 27:31 | 1:00:39 | 2:07:38 | 5:42-6:06 |\n| 85 | 12:35 | 26:03 | 57:25 | 2:01:06 | 5:24-5:48 |\n\n*Note: Times are approximate. Use the Daniels-Gilbert formula programmatically for precise values.*\n\n### Coaching Adjustments\n\n- **Marathon derating:** Many coaches derate VDOT predictions by 1-1.5 points for half marathon and 2-3 points for full marathon to account for training specificity and fueling challenges.\n- **Best input distances:** 5K and 10K races provide the most reliable VDOT estimates (long enough for aerobic measurement, short enough for maximal effort).\n- **Recalculation frequency:** Every 4-8 weeks, or after each race.\n- **Train at current VDOT, not goal VDOT.**\n\n### Sources\n- [VDOT O2 Official Calculator](https://vdoto2.com/calculator)\n- [VDOT Training Definitions](https://vdoto2.com/learn-more/training-definitions)\n- [Daniels-Gilbert Formula - RunBundle](https://runbundle.com/tools/vo2-max-calculators/vo2-max-calculator)\n- [VDOT Training Tables - RunDNA](https://rundna.com/resources/run-training/vdot-training-tables-how-to-use-them/)\n- [Demystifying VDOT - T2M Coaching](https://www.tri2max.com/demystifying-vdot)\n- [Sport Calculator - VDOT](https://sport-calculator.com/calculators/running/jack-daniels-running-calculator)\n- [Daniels-Gilbert Formula GitHub](https://github.com/mekeetsa/vdot)\n\n---\n\n## 5. ML/Modern Approaches\n\n### Overview of Research\n\nMachine learning approaches to race prediction have grown significantly, particularly using large-scale data from platforms like Strava and major marathon race databases.\n\n### Key Models and Papers\n\n#### A. Strava's Performance Predictions (Production System)\n- Uses an ML model leveraging **100+ athlete data attributes** including all-time run history and top performances\n- Only uses real activity data (not theoretical VO2max estimates)\n- Leverages performances from athletes with similar training histories\n- Requires at least 20 run activities within a rolling 24-week window\n- Generates new predictions after each run upload\n- Calculates times for each race distance independently\n\n#### B. LSTM Neural Networks for Generalized Prediction (PMC, 2024)\n- \"Win Your Race Goal\" study analyzed 15,686 runs from 15 runners\n- LSTM regression approach achieved **89.13% accuracy**\n- Time series regression (TSR) approach achieved 85.21%\n- Compared against Riegel formula and UltraSignup formula across 60 races\n- Works across marathon to ultramarathon distances with varying elevation\n\n#### C. XGBoost for Ultramarathons (Scientific Reports, 2025)\n- Predicts running speed from age, gender, country, event location\n- For 100-mile races: R-squared = 0.23 (moderate for population-level prediction)\n- Event location was the most important predictor\n- For 50-mile races: similar XGBoost approach with improved results\n\n#### D. Case-Based Reasoning / CBR (Springer, 2024)\n- Uses \"nearest neighbor\" runners from large databases\n- Predictions based on maximally similar runners in feature space\n- More interpretable than black-box ML approaches\n- Can add new cases without retraining\n- Well-suited to the noisy nature of GPS/running data\n\n#### E. Marathon Prediction from Half-Marathon (Frontiers in Physiology, 2025/2026)\n- Predicts marathon time using age group, half-marathon time, sex, and half-marathon pacing strategy\n- Intraclass correlation (ICC) = 0.92 between predicted and actual times\n- Used Valencia Marathon data; compared against VDOT model\n\n#### F. In-Race Finish Time Prediction (ACM, 2019)\n- \"Pace My Race\" system using 7,931 high-resolution marathon performances\n- Real-time pacing recommendations during the race\n- Outperforms existing techniques for in-race prediction\n\n### Key Features That Matter\n\n| Feature Category | Specific Features | Importance |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Training volume** | Weekly mileage, long run distance, total runs | High |\n| **Training intensity** | Average pace, pace distribution, HR zones | High |\n| **Prior race performance** | Recent 5K/10K/HM times | Very High |\n| **Demographics** | Age, sex | Moderate |\n| **Training consistency** | Runs per week, training streak, missed days | Moderate |\n| **Course characteristics** | Elevation gain, terrain, location | Moderate |\n| **Pacing behavior** | Even/negative split tendency, variability | Moderate |\n| **Training progression** | Fitness trend (improving/declining) | Moderate |\n| **Heart rate data** | Resting HR, training HR, HR drift | Moderate (when available) |\n\n### Algorithms Ranked by Performance\n\nBased on the literature:\n1. **XGBoost / Gradient Boosting** -- consistently strong across studies\n2. **Decision Trees** -- surprisingly competitive; simple and interpretable\n3. **LSTM / Recurrent Neural Networks** -- best for time-series training data\n4. **Case-Based Reasoning (k-NN)** -- excellent interpretability, handles noisy data\n5. **Random Forest** -- solid but typically slightly behind gradient boosting\n6. **Linear Regression** -- good baseline; the problem is near-linear for many feature sets\n7. **Bayesian Ridge Regression** -- useful for uncertainty quantification\n\n### ML vs. Classical Formulas\n\n| Aspect | Classical (Riegel/VDOT/Cameron) | ML Approaches |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Input** | Single recent race result | Entire training history |\n| **Data needed** | 1 race time + distance | 20+ activities over 24 weeks |\n| **Personalization** | Limited (population average) | High (individual patterns) |\n| **Interpretability** | High (clear formula) | Variable (high for CBR, low for NN) |\n| **Accuracy for trained runners** | Good (within 3-5%) | Better (within 1-3%) |\n| **Cold start** | Works with 1 data point | Needs substantial history |\n| **Environmental factors** | Not included | Can be incorporated |\n\n### Notable Tools\n- **Strava Performance Predictions** -- ML-powered, subscriber feature\n- **Garmin Race Predictor** -- Uses VO2max estimates from wearable data\n- **Metathon** -- ML-based marathon prediction platform\n- **42cal** -- Multi-model race predictor\n\n### Sources\n- [Win Your Race Goal - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11495242/)\n- [XGBoost for Ultra-Marathon - Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92581-w)\n- [Learning to Run Marathons - Springer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-67256-9_13)\n- [Strava Performance Predictions](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/35272903405965-Performance-Predictions)\n- [Strava ML blog announcement](https://communityhub.strava.com/what-s-new-10/we-know-how-fast-you-ll-run-your-next-race-9441)\n- [ML Marathon Prediction Medium article](https://medium.com/runners-life/i-was-tired-of-flawed-race-predictions-so-i-built-a-model-that-actually-understands-runners-179a2a1e57a4)\n- [Quantifying Uncertainty in Marathon Predictions (CMU)](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/conference/2024/assets/pdf/Onyejekwe24.pdf)\n- [Modelling Training Practices (ACM)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3565472.3592952)\n- [Frontiers in Physiology - Marathon from Half (2026)](https://public-pages-files-2025.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2025.1718298/pdf)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Adjustment Factors\n\n### 6.1 Temperature / Heat\n\n#### Simple Coaching Rule of Thumb\n```\npace_adjustment_sec_per_mile = (temp_F - 65) * 2    (for temp > 65F)\n```\nExample: At 88F, add 46 seconds per mile.\n\n#### Percentage-Based Model\n```\npace_increase_pct = 0.4% * max(0, temp_F - 60) + 0.2% * max(0, humidity_pct - 60)\n```\n\n#### Temperature + Dew Point Method\n\nSum temperature (F) and dew point (F), then look up:\n\n| Temp + Dew Point Sum | Pace Adjustment |\n|---|---|\n| <= 100 | No adjustment |\n| 101-110 | 0% to 0.5% |\n| 111-120 | 0.5% to 1.0% |\n| 121-130 | 1.0% to 2.0% |\n| 131-140 | 2.0% to 3.0% |\n| 141-150 | 3.0% to 4.5% |\n| 151-160 | 4.5% to 6.0% |\n| 161-170 | 6.0% to 8.0% |\n| 171-180 | 8.0% to 10.0% |\n| >180 | Hard running not recommended |\n\n#### Research-Based Marathon Heat Table (from Fellrnr / 42,000 finish times)\n\nApproximate performance degradation by heat index temperature for marathon:\n\n| Heat Index | Performance Loss (approx.) |\n|---|---|\n| 40-50F (4-10C) | Optimal; 0% |\n| 55F (13C) | 0-1% |\n| 60F (16C) | 1-3% |\n| 65F (18C) | 2-5% |\n| 70F (21C) | 4-8% |\n| 75F (24C) | 6-12% |\n| 80F (27C) | 8-16% |\n| 85F (29C) | 12-20% |\n\n*Ranges depend on runner's pace -- slower runners are affected more.*\n\n#### Key Research Finding\nHeat and humidity have a **multiplicative** effect: hot and humid is much worse than either in isolation. Humidity effects become negligible below ~65F (18C). Ideal marathon conditions: 35-55F (2-13C).\n\n### 6.2 Altitude\n\n#### General Rules of Thumb\n\n```\nperformance_loss_pct = 2% per 1000 feet above sea level\n```\n\nMore refined (below sea-level threshold):\n```\nperformance_loss_pct = 2% per 1000 feet above 3000 feet\n```\n\nEffects are not typically noticeable below 3,000 feet (914m).\n\n#### Jack Daniels' Altitude Guidelines\n\n| Altitude (ft) | Pace Slowdown (sec/mile) |\n|---|---|\n| 3,000 | Threshold of effect |\n| 4,000 | 4-5 sec/mile |\n| 5,000 | 8-10 sec/mile |\n| 6,000 | 12-15 sec/mile |\n| 7,000 | 16-20 sec/mile |\n| 8,000 | 20-25 sec/mile |\n\n#### VO2max-Based Model\n\n```\nvo2max_reduction_pct = 6.3% per 1000m above 300m    (elite athletes)\n                     = 7.0% per 1000m               (general population)\n                     = 8-11% per 1000m               (some studies)\n```\n\n**Important:** Race performance loss is **less** than raw VO2max reduction because athletes do not race at 100% VO2max. Olympic data shows 2-4% slower endurance times above 1000m.\n\n#### Acclimatization\n- 2-3 weeks of acclimatization reduces the impact by approximately half\n- Allow 2-3 days for moderate altitudes (1,500-2,500m)\n- Allow 1-2 weeks for high altitudes (2,500m+)\n\n### 6.3 Course Elevation / Grade Adjusted Pace (GAP)\n\n#### D.B. Dill's Oxygen Cost Model\nVertical oxygen cost: **1.31 ml O2 / kg / meter climbed**\n\n#### Jack Daniels' Simple Rule\n- **Uphill:** Add 12-15 seconds per 100m (328 ft) of elevation gain per mile\n- **Downhill:** Subtract 7-8 seconds per 100m of elevation loss per mile\n- Downhill benefit is ~55% of uphill cost\n\n#### Energy Cost per Grade\n- Each 1% grade increase costs approximately **3-4% more energy**\n- A 5% grade requires ~15-20% more energy than flat running\n\n#### Minetti et al. (2002) Polynomial Model\n\nEnergy cost of running (Cr, in J/kg/m) as a function of gradient *i* (expressed as a decimal, e.g., 0.10 for 10%):\n\n**5th-order polynomial (walking, widely cited form):**\n```\nCr(i) = 280.5*i^5 - 58.7*i^4 - 76.8*i^3 + 51.9*i^2 + 19.6*i + 2.5\n```\n\nKey data points for running from Minetti's measurements:\n- Level (0%): 3.40 J/kg/m\n- Optimal downhill (-10%): ~1.73 J/kg/m (minimum metabolic cost)\n- +10% grade: ~7.0 J/kg/m\n- +45% grade: ~18.93 J/kg/m\n\n#### Flat-Equivalent Distance Formula\n```\nflat_equivalent_distance = distance + k1 * elevation_gain - k2 * elevation_loss\n```\n\nWhere k1 > k2 (uphill costs more than downhill saves). Typical values: k1 ~ 7-10, k2 ~ 3-5 (multiplied by vertical meters to produce equivalent horizontal meters).\n\n#### Key Asymmetry\nRunning up a 10% grade slows pace by ~45%. Running down a 10% grade speeds pace by only ~13%. Uphills hurt much more than downhills help.\n\n### 6.4 Wind\n\n- **Headwind:** Increases metabolic cost proportional to wind speed squared (drag force)\n- **Tailwind benefit is approximately 50% of headwind cost** (asymmetric effect)\n- No widely-used correction formula for running (unlike cycling)\n- Rule of thumb: A 10 mph headwind costs roughly 5-8% more energy; a 10 mph tailwind saves roughly 2-4%\n\n### 6.5 Age Grading (WMA)\n\n#### Formula\n```\nage_graded_time = actual_time / age_factor\nage_grade_pct = (open_world_record / age_graded_time) * 100\n```\n\n#### Current Tables\n- **WMA 2023 tables** (effective January 1, 2023) are the current standard\n- **2025 road running tables** approved January 10, 2025 by USATF Masters (improved interpolation for distances other than 5K, 10K, HM, Marathon)\n- Age factors available for ages 8-100, both genders\n- Factors derived from millions of performances and validated against individual athlete careers spanning decades\n\n#### Performance Level Classification\n\n| Age-Grade % | Classification |\n|---|---|\n| >90% | World class |\n| 80-89% | National class |\n| 70-79% | Regional class |\n| 60-69% | Local competitive |\n| 50-59% | Recreational |\n| <50% | Beginner |\n\n#### Sources for Tables\n- [WMA Age-Grading Calculator](https://www.howardgrubb.co.uk/athletics/wmalookup15.html)\n- [Age-Grade Tables GitHub](https://github.com/AlanLyttonJones/Age-Grade-Tables)\n- [RunBundle Age Grading Calculator](https://runbundle.com/tools/age-grading-calculator)\n\n### 6.6 Fitness Trend (Improving vs. Maintaining)\n\nNo standardized formula exists, but practical approaches:\n\n1. **VDOT trajectory:** Track VDOT from races every 4-8 weeks. Fit a trendline. Extrapolate cautiously (1-2 VDOT points per training cycle max).\n2. **Training load trend:** If weekly mileage and intensity are increasing, predictions should be adjusted optimistically; if plateaued, use current fitness level.\n3. **Rule of thumb:** A runner who has been improving steadily for 3+ months can reasonably target 1-2% faster than current race-equivalent predictions.\n4. **Caution:** Never extrapolate improvement indefinitely. Fitness gains follow a logarithmic curve -- large gains early, diminishing returns over years.\n\n### Sources (Section 6)\n- [Fellrnr Impact of Heat on Marathon Performance](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/Impact_of_Heat_on_Marathon_Performance)\n- [Running Writings Heat Calculator](https://apps.runningwritings.com/heat-adjusted-pace/)\n- [Running Writings Heat & Humidity Analysis](https://runningwritings.com/2025/04/heat-humidity-marathon-times.html)\n- [Final Surge Altitude Calculator](https://www.finalsurge.com/altitude-conversion-calculator)\n- [VDOT Altitude Adjustments](https://news.vdoto2.com/2011/03/ask-a-coach-how-do-you-adjust-threshold-pace-at-altitude/)\n- [RunBundle GAP Calculator](https://runbundle.com/tools/grade-adjusted-pace-calculator)\n- [Running Writings GAP Calculator](https://apps.runningwritings.com/gap-calculator/)\n- [Minetti et al. 2002 - Energy Cost at Extreme Slopes (PubMed)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12183501/)\n- [Runners Connect Altitude Guide](https://runnersconnect.net/high-altitude-training-running-performance/)\n- [TrainingPeaks Heat/Humidity/Wind/Altitude](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/coach-blog/preparing-for-heat-humidity-wind-and-altitude/)\n- [WMA Age-Grade Tables - EMA](https://european-masters-athletics.org/wma-proposed-age-grading-tables/)\n- [USATF Masters Age Grading](https://usatfmasters.org/age-grading/)\n\n---\n\n## 7. Practical Application for a Coaching AI\n\n### 7.1 When to Use Which Model\n\n| Scenario | Recommended Model | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|\n| Runner has 1 recent race, wants prediction at similar distance | **Riegel** | Simple, reliable for nearby distances |\n| Runner has 1 recent race, wants training paces | **VDOT** | Directly produces 5 training zones |\n| Runner has extensive training log, targeting marathon | **Tanda** | Uses actual training data, not just race results |\n| Runner has multiple race results at different distances | **Riegel with personal exponent** | Calibrated fatigue factor beats population average |\n| Runner has rich Strava/GPS history | **ML model** | Leverages full training context |\n| Comparing fitness across ages | **WMA Age Grading** | Standardized, well-validated |\n| No race data available, only training data | **Tanda** or **ML** | Only models that work without race input |\n| Elite runner, 800m-marathon range | **Cameron** | Derived from world-class performances |\n| Cold start (new user, minimal data) | **Riegel** or **VDOT** | Work with a single data point |\n\n### 7.2 Decision Tree for Model Selection\n\n```\nDoes the runner have a recent race result (within 6 weeks)?\n  YES:\n    Is the target distance within 2-4x of the race distance?\n      YES -> Use Riegel AND VDOT. Compare predictions.\n      NO -> Use VDOT (better for larger distance jumps)\n    Does the runner have training log data for the past 8 weeks?\n      YES -> Also run Tanda (for marathon predictions)\n    Does the runner have multiple race results at different distances?\n      YES -> Compute personal Riegel exponent. Weight this heavily.\n  NO:\n    Does the runner have 8+ weeks of training data?\n      YES -> Use Tanda (marathon) or ML model (other distances)\n      NO -> Cannot make reliable prediction. Ask runner to do a time trial.\n```\n\n### 7.3 Combining Multiple Predictions\n\n**Ensemble approach (recommended):**\n\n1. Run all applicable models given available data\n2. Compute weighted average:\n   ```\n   final_prediction = w1*riegel + w2*vdot + w3*tanda + w4*cameron\n   ```\n3. Suggested weights:\n   - If race data is recent and reliable: Riegel (0.30), VDOT (0.35), Cameron (0.15), Tanda (0.20)\n   - If only training data: Tanda (0.70), ML if available (0.30)\n   - If multiple races at different distances: Personal Riegel exponent model (0.50), VDOT (0.30), Cameron (0.20)\n\n4. **Concordance check:** If all models agree within 2-3%, confidence is high. If they diverge by >5%, investigate why:\n   - Large divergence often indicates the runner is a \"speedster\" or \"endurance specialist\"\n   - Divergence between Riegel and VDOT for marathon suggests undertrained for the distance\n\n### 7.4 Confidence Intervals\n\n**Practical uncertainty bands:**\n\n| Prediction Type | 50% Confidence | 80% Confidence | 95% Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 5K from 10K | +/- 1% | +/- 2% | +/- 3% |\n| Half from 10K | +/- 2% | +/- 4% | +/- 6% |\n| Marathon from half | +/- 3% | +/- 5% | +/- 8% |\n| Marathon from 5K | +/- 5% | +/- 8% | +/- 12% |\n| Marathon from training (Tanda) | +/- 2% (~4 min) | +/- 4% (~8 min) | +/- 6% (~12 min) |\n\n**Factors that widen confidence intervals:**\n- Input race was not a maximal effort\n- Input race was >6 weeks ago\n- Large distance ratio (e.g., 5K to marathon)\n- Runner is new to the target distance\n- Runner's training volume is mismatched for target distance\n- Environmental conditions differ between input race and target race\n\n**Factors that narrow confidence intervals:**\n- Multiple concordant model predictions\n- Personal Riegel exponent from multiple races\n- Tanda model with consistent 8-week training block\n- Runner has previously raced the target distance\n\n### 7.5 Pre-Prediction Adjustments\n\nBefore generating a final prediction, apply corrections in this order:\n\n1. **Normalize input race:** Adjust the input race time for any environmental factors (heat, altitude, wind) that were present. Get the \"ideal conditions\" equivalent time.\n2. **Generate raw prediction** using selected model(s).\n3. **Apply target-race adjustments:** Correct for the expected environmental conditions of the target race (temperature, altitude, elevation profile).\n4. **Apply training-volume sanity check:** If the runner's weekly mileage is below what's typically needed for the distance, derate the prediction.\n5. **Apply fitness-trend adjustment:** If the runner is on an improving trajectory, allow a small optimistic adjustment (1-2%).\n6. **Present with confidence interval.**\n\n### 7.6 Marathon-Specific Weekly Mileage Sanity Check\n\n| Weekly Mileage (mi) | Realistic Marathon Target |\n|---|---|\n| 20-30 | Finish only; predictions unreliable |\n| 30-40 | 4:00-5:00+ depending on speed |\n| 40-50 | 3:30-4:30 |\n| 50-60 | 3:00-3:45 |\n| 60-70 | 2:45-3:15 |\n| 70-80 | 2:30-3:00 |\n| 80-100 | Sub-2:45 |\n| 100+ | Elite territory |\n\nIf a 5K-based prediction suggests a marathon time that is unrealistic for the runner's training volume, the coaching AI should flag this and present a range based on the mileage-adjusted expectation.\n\n### 7.7 Communication to Runners\n\nThe coaching AI should:\n1. **Always present a range**, not a single number. \"Based on your recent 10K, your marathon potential is 3:25-3:35.\"\n2. **Explain the assumptions.** \"This assumes you'll average 50+ miles/week in your training block and race in moderate conditions.\"\n3. **Flag mismatches.** \"Your 5K speed suggests 3:15, but your current mileage of 35 miles/week makes 3:35-3:45 more realistic.\"\n4. **Use multiple models when possible** and explain concordance: \"Three different models agree on 3:28-3:32, which gives us high confidence in this range.\"\n5. **Recommend calibration races.** \"Run a half marathon 4-6 weeks before your target marathon to refine the prediction.\"\n\n### Sources (Section 7)\n- [Sport Calculator - Race Prediction Guide](https://sport-calculator.com/blog/how-to-predict-race-times-vdot-critical-speed)\n- [Runners Connect - Race Calculator Accuracy](https://runnersconnect.net/race-calculators/)\n- [Quantifying Uncertainty in Marathon Predictions (CMU)](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/conference/2024/assets/pdf/Onyejekwe24.pdf)\n- [Multi-Model Prediction Approach (Medium)](https://medium.com/runners-life/i-was-tired-of-flawed-race-predictions-so-i-built-a-model-that-actually-understands-runners-179a2a1e57a4)\n- [Modelling Training Practices for Personalised Recommendations (ACM)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3565472.3592952)\n- [RunBundle General Race Predictors](https://runbundle.com/tools/race-predictors/general-race-predictors)\n\n---\n\n## Summary of All Formulas (Quick Reference)\n\n### Riegel\n```\nT2 = T1 * (D2/D1)^1.06\n```\n\n### Cameron\n```\nT2 = T1 * (D2/D1) * f(D1)/f(D2)\nf(x) = 13.49681 - 0.000030363*x + 835.7114/x^0.7905    [x in meters]\n```\n\n### Tanda\n```\nPm(sec/km) = 17.1 + 140.0 * exp(-0.0053 * K) + 0.55 * P\nK = mean weekly km, P = mean training pace (sec/km), 8-week window\n```\n\n### VDOT (Daniels-Gilbert)\n```\nVDOT = (-4.60 + 0.182258*v + 0.000104*v^2) / (0.8 + 0.1894393*e^(-0.012778*t) + 0.2989558*e^(-0.1932605*t))\nv = velocity (m/min), t = time (min)\n```\n\n### Personal Riegel Exponent (from 2 races)\n```\nexponent = ln(T2/T1) / ln(D2/D1)\n```\n\n### Heat Adjustment (percentage-based)\n```\npace_increase_pct = 0.4% * max(0, temp_F - 60) + 0.2% * max(0, humidity_pct - 60)\n```\n\n### Altitude Adjustment\n```\npace_loss_pct ≈ 2% per 1000 ft above 3000 ft (unacclimatized)\n```\n\n### Age Grading\n```\nage_graded_time = actual_time / WMA_age_factor\nage_grade_pct = open_world_record / age_graded_time * 100\n```\n\n### Grade Adjusted Pace (simplified Daniels)\n```\ntime_adjustment = +12 to 15 sec per 100m elevation gain per mile\n                  -7 to 8 sec per 100m elevation loss per mile\n```"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4113,"cache_read_input_tokens":45849,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4113,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY8NdZXeg4RoBFuoDiDfN","type":"assistant","uuid":"994a0b05-19fa-4e98-bac2-36330bba5a37","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:46:01.935Z"}
