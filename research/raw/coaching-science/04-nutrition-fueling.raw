the addition of protein may help to offset muscle damage and promote recovery.\n\n### Post-Exercise Protein & Glycogen Recovery\n\nPost-exercise administration of protein when combined with suboptimal intake of carbohydrates (<1.2 g/kg/day) can heighten muscle glycogen recovery, and may help mitigate changes in muscle damage markers.\n\n### Rapid Glycogen Restoration Strategy (Combining Carbs + Protein)\n\nIf rapid restoration of glycogen is required (< 4 h of recovery time), strategies should include combining carbohydrates (0.8 g/kg/h) with protein (0.2–0.4 g/kg/h).\n\n### During Endurance Exercise\n\nIngestion of carbohydrate + protein or EAAs during endurance and resistance exercise can help to maintain a favorable anabolic hormone profile, minimize increases in muscle damage, promote increases in muscle cross-sectional area, and increase time to exhaustion during prolonged running and cycling.\n\n### When Carbohydrate Intake is Insufficient\n\nWhen carbohydrate delivery is inadequate, adding protein may help increase performance, ameliorate muscle damage, promote euglycemia and facilitate glycogen re-synthesis.\n\n### Protein Timing Window\n\nThe optimal time period during which to ingest protein is likely a matter of individual tolerance, since benefits are derived from pre- or post-workout ingestion; however, the anabolic effect of exercise is long-lasting (at least 24 h), but likely diminishes with increasing time post-exercise.\n\n### Leucine Content\n\nAcute protein doses should strive to contain 700–3000 mg of leucine and/or a higher relative leucine content, in addition to a balanced array of the essential amino acids (EAAs).\n\n### Pre-Sleep Protein\n\nPre-sleep casein protein intake (30–40 g) provides increases in overnight MPS and metabolic rate without influencing lipolysis.\n\n---\n\n**Key Sources:**\n- **ISSN Position Stand: Protein and Exercise** (Jäger et al., 2017) – *Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition*\n- **ISSN Position Stand: Nutrient Timing** (Kerksick et al., 2017) – *Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition*\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"db95baa2-b1e5-4842-a7e4-ccb0680f3267","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:36:20.386Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"eeec6a1d-f0e2-4c87-b04e-9828ad4a0788"}

The IOC recommends 1.8 to 2.7 g/kg/day when an athlete is trying to lose fat while gaining lean mass. Overall, athletes should consume approximately 15% to 30% of their calories from protein sources.\n\n- For building muscle mass and maintaining muscle mass through a positive muscle protein balance, an overall daily protein intake in the range of 1.4–2.0 g protein/kg body weight/day is sufficient for most exercising individuals.\n\n- Recommendations regarding the optimal protein intake per serving for athletes to maximize MPS are dependent upon age and recent resistance exercise stimuli. General recommendations are 0.25 g of a high-quality protein per kg of body weight, or an absolute dose of 20–40 g.\n\n## Carbohydrate Recommendations\n\n- Athletes have varied carbohydrate requirements based on training intensity, type of workout, and timing during their season. In general, athletes will need to consume 3 to 5 g per kilogram body weight daily for light activity and upward of 8 to 12 g per kilogram body weight per day for intense training.\n\n- Endogenous glycogen stores are maximized by following a high-carbohydrate diet (8–12 g of carbohydrate/kg/day); moreover, these stores are depleted most by high volume exercise.\n\n- Athletes involved in moderate amounts of intense training (e.g., 2–3 h per day of intense exercise performed 5–6 times per week) typically need to consume a diet consisting of 5–8 g/kg/day or 250–1200 g/day for 50–150 kg athletes of carbohydrate to maintain liver and muscle glycogen stores.\n\n- For extended (> 60 min) bouts of high intensity (> 70% VO2max) exercise, carbohydrate should be consumed at a rate of ~30–60 g of carbohydrate/h in a 6–8% carbohydrate-electrolyte solution.\n\n## General Fitness / Baseline Macronutrient Needs\n\n- Individuals engaged in a general fitness program can typically meet daily needs by consuming a normal diet: 45–55% CHO (3–5 g/kg/day), 15–20% PRO (0.8–1.2 g/kg/day), and 25–35% fat (0.5–1.5 g/kg/day).\n\n## Nutrient Timing for Recovery\n\n- If rapid restoration of glycogen is required (< 4 h of recovery time), strategies include aggressive carbohydrate refeeding (1.2 g/kg/h) with high glycemic index sources, caffeine addition (3–8 mg/kg), or combining carbohydrates (0.8 g/kg/h) with protein (0.2–0.4 g/kg/h).\n\n## Broader Context\n\n- The field of sports nutrition has seen the publication of numerous new research papers, accompanied by the release of 17 fresh consensus statements and recommendation papers from authoritative organizations such as the IOC, ACSM, and ISSN.\n\n- An athlete will have different macronutrient goals depending on sport, timing of exercise, and season status.\n\n- A high proportion of carbohydrates in the diet can significantly enhance performance during endurance and intense training, achieved by increasing exogenous carbohydrate availability and storing carbohydrates (glycogen) in muscles and the liver.\n\n## Micronutrient Notes\n\n- The IOC recommends 1500 mg per day of calcium along with 1500 to 2000 IU vitamin D to optimize bone health for at-risk athletes.\n\nThese recommendations remain the foundational guidelines cited across the sports nutrition literature. The most recent narrative review from *Frontiers in Nutrition* (January 2024) continues to reference these same ACSM, ISSN, and IOC position stands as the authoritative sources for macronutrient guidance for endurance athletes and runners.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"2bcee154-f17b-49b9-a112-0d7abacae3f4","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:36:22.503Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"7dcf6cd2-c2b1-4383-b7de-d266518ff3b7"}

This method has been used in research by Prof. John Hawley and colleagues, and they found that the sleep low method may exaggerate some of the training adaptations.\n\n2. **Fasted Training**: Training in the morning either fasted or after a low-carb meal or snack is one of the easiest ways to train low. By training after an overnight fast, the athlete would have lower liver glycogen stores but their muscle glycogen would remain unaffected.\n\n3. **Fuel for the Work Required**: This practical model of CHO periodization suggests that CHO availability should be manipulated day-to-day and meal-by-meal according to the intensity, duration, and specific training goals, meaning fuelling with enough carbohydrates to complete high-quality sessions.\n\n### The Glycogen Threshold Hypothesis\n\nThe most cited paper on this topic is the 2018 article titled \"Fuel for the Work Required: A Theoretical Framework for Carbohydrate Periodization and the Glycogen Threshold Hypothesis.\" The authors proposed that glycogen concentration should be below the threshold of 300 mmol/kg dry weight muscle after training, but should not be lower than 100 mmol/kg as this may start to impair muscle protein synthesis.\n\n### Cellular and Molecular Benefits\n\nWhen compared with high CHO availability, data suggest that augmented cell signalling (73% of 11 studies), gene expression (75% of 12 studies), and training-induced increases in oxidative enzyme activity/protein content (78% of 9 studies) associated with \"train low\" are especially apparent when training sessions are commenced within a specific range of muscle glycogen concentrations.\n\nAcute exercise studies have revealed that training or recovery with low muscle glycogen stimulates factors of importance for mitochondrial biogenesis in addition to favourable metabolic adaptations in trained athletes.\n\n### Does It Actually Improve Performance?\n\nThe evidence is mixed:\n\n- Over 70% of the research trials measuring cellular/molecular outcomes in relation to carbohydrate periodisation have produced positive outcomes. However, such muscle adaptations do not always translate to improved exercise performance. For the studies measuring performance outcomes, only 37% showed an improvement, whilst 63% resulted in no change to performance.\n\n- **2024 Study (Prieto-Bellver et al.)**: In 2024, Prieto-Bellver and colleagues randomised 17 highly-trained cyclists (VO₂max = 71) to either a periodised carbohydrate group or a high-carbohydrate group for 5 weeks. They found no between-group differences in changes in carbohydrate or lipid oxidation, heart rate, lactate, time-to-exhaustion, or maximal lactate steady state (MLSS). This suggests that, in highly trained endurance athletes, carbohydrate periodization during a training block is not superior to a high carbohydrate diet.\n\n- **2021 Meta-Analysis (JISSN)**: The meta-analysis demonstrated no overall effect of CHO periodization on endurance performance compared to control endurance training with normal (high) CHO availability. Based on the available literature, the authors concluded that periodized CHO restriction does not per se enhance performance in endurance-trained athletes.\n\n- **2024–2025 Triathlete Study**: After 6-week diet adaptation, time-to-exhaustion (TTE) performance was similar across both LCHF and HCLF diets. Minimal carbohydrate supplementation (10 g/h) during exercise eliminated exercise-induced hypoglycemia and improved TTE by 22% on both diets.\n\n### What Elite Runners Actually Do\n\nThe best endurance runners on the planet — East Africans — habitually eat a high carbohydrate diet to support their high training load. However, anecdotal accounts document that Kenyan distance runners adopt carbohydrate periodization principles as part of their habits of daily living — observations supported by published studies documenting frequent use of \"train low\" approaches among world-class East African distance runners.\n\n### Practical Takeaways\n\n- The evidence that a persistent low-carb ketogenic diet is good for athletic performance is weak. At best, a low-carb high-fat diet yields comparable performance outcomes, but the bulk of evidence shows that low-carb high-fat diets impair endurance performance.\n\n- Periodising your carbohydrate availability can help augment some of the intended training adaptations while ensuring you have high carbohydrate availability to maintain high power output during key sessions and races.\n\n- For the most challenging sessions of your week or ones where you are expected to perform, it makes sense to consume plenty of carbs before and during these sessions, whilst lighter training sessions may be an opportunity to use a train low approach.\n\n- The optimal way to incorporate train low or carbohydrate periodisation is not currently known, but the consensus is moving toward a nuanced, individualized approach rather than a blanket recommendation.\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nThe \"train low, compete high\" concept has strong theoretical and molecular support, but translating those cellular adaptations into measurable race-day performance gains remains elusive in controlled research settings. The most pragmatic approach appears to be strategically reducing carbs around easy/low-intensity sessions while ensuring full carbohydrate availability for key workouts and competitions.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"0e60ef06-18c3-4ae6-a453-f7a91e21d013","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:36:37.268Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"48659902-3965-4a7c-a7ec-dbd7b446c7c1"}

If you're a 70kg (154lb) runner, that means 560–840g of carbs per day.\n\n- Some experts recommend a slightly narrower range. The recommended amount for an effective carb load is 8–10 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of bodyweight per day of your carb load.\n\n- People should eat 10 to 12 grams of carbs per kilogram per day when carbo loading. According to Baylor College of Medicine, an average person weighing 70 kg (~150 lbs.) would have to eat a minimum of 700 grams of carbohydrates per day.\n\n- Current recommendations are 10g carbohydrate per kg body weight per day (range 7–12g/kg).\n\n### Duration of Carb Loading\n\nModern research has significantly shortened the required loading period:\n\n- Modern research shows there's no need to deplete glycogen stores before loading, and carb loading for just 24–36 hours is adequate, especially for trained athletes.\n- For most recreational marathoners, the sweet spot is 2–3 days pre-race. For highly trained athletes, 1–2 days may suffice.\n- A carb load should last 2–3 days before a marathon. Start increasing your carbohydrate intake three days before the race. If your marathon is on a Sunday, aim to start eating your goal carbohydrate intake on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.\n\n### No Depletion Phase Needed\n\nThe old \"deplete-then-load\" protocol from the 1960s is now considered outdated:\n\n- Research showed you could achieve nearly the same glycogen levels without the depletion phase. Even better: well-trained athletes could max out their stores in just 1–2 days instead of a full week.\n- Modern carb loading eliminates the harmful depletion phase. You simply reduce training while increasing carbs—much easier and more effective.\n\n### Performance Benefits\n\n- Carb loading has been found to improve performance by 2–3%.\n- Carbohydrate loading can improve endurance performance by up to 20% by increasing muscle glycogen concentrations compared to standard diets.\n\n### Weight Gain Is Normal\n\n- Each gram of glycogen is stored with 3 grams of water, which explains the 1–2kg weight gain you might notice.\n- Research shows that the benefit of full glycogen stores outweighs the demands of carrying the extra body weight.\n\n### Practical Tips\n\n- This is not the time to eat high-fiber foods such as beans or high-fiber breakfast cereals, as it can exacerbate gastrointestinal distress on race day. Eat carbs such as pasta, white rice, white bread, pancakes, cereal, fruit bars, fruit leather, sports bar/gels and even hard candy when carbo loading.\n- Spread the carbohydrates out throughout meals and snacks. Carb loading involves eating a lot. Spread those carbohydrates out equally throughout the day, aiming for three meals and two to three snacks.\n- Your glycogen stores will benefit from an extra carb \"top up\" on marathon morning following your overnight fast. The recommendation is 1–4g carbohydrate per kg body weight, consumed 1–4 hours before the marathon starts.\n\n### In-Race Fueling (New 2025 Research)\n\nA new study on elite marathoners tested in-race fueling rates. For most athletes, a fueling target of 70–90 g/h strikes a better balance between performance and tolerability, especially when backed by consistent gut training. Elite runners burned more ingested carbs and became more metabolically efficient at 120 g/h, even though GI distress was common.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** The current evidence-based recommendation is to consume **8–12 g of carbs per kg of body weight per day** for **1–3 days** before a marathon, using low-fiber, easily digestible carbohydrate sources, without any prior depletion phase.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6392a025-a55d-4d32-9236-48dc3935501b","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:37:15.965Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"28430c2f-d397-4130-982f-c4e3da6037d8"}

Because there is considerable variability in sweating rates and sweat electrolyte content between individuals, customized fluid replacement programs are recommended.\n\n### Pre-Exercise Hydration\n- The goal of prehydrating is to start the activity euhydrated and with normal plasma electrolyte levels.\n- Prehydrating with beverages, in addition to normal meals and fluid intake, should be initiated when needed at least several hours before the activity to enable fluid absorption and allow urine output to return to normal levels.\n- Before exercise, ACSM recommends consuming fluids at least 4 hours before exercise. If you are well hydrated this should lead to urine production. If it doesn't, or the urine is dark in color, you should drink more fluid about 2 hours before exercise, allowing sufficient time for urine to be eliminated before starting.\n\n### During Exercise\n- The goal of drinking during exercise is to prevent excessive (>2% body weight loss from water deficit) dehydration and excessive changes in electrolyte balance to avert compromised performance.\n- The ACSM considers a fluid intake of 0.4–0.8 L/h during intense endurance activities to be optimal, although higher drinking quantities apply for faster, heavier athletes at warm temperatures and lower recommendations for slower, lighter athletes at cooler temperatures.\n- Complete rehydration during exercise is not necessary since fluid losses of 2–4% of body weight can be tolerated, and increased fluid intake during physical activity can cause gastrointestinal problems and increases the risk of hyponatremia.\n\n## Sweat Rate Calculation\n\n- Individual sweat rates can be estimated by measuring body weight before and after exercise.\n- The optimal drinking quantity is based upon the sweat rate, which can be between 0.3 and 2.5 L/h.\n- For people with high sweat rates (>2 liters per hour), it will be difficult to replace all fluids during exercise because the stomach only absorbs ~1.2 liters per hour.\n\n### Post-Exercise Rehydration Formula\n- Post-exercise rehydration should be 150% of body mass loss during exercise. The calculation is: Pre-exercise weight (kg) – Post-exercise weight (kg) × 1.5 = Fluid needs for replacement per ACSM guidelines. For every 1 kg (2.2 lb) loss, an additional 1 L of fluid is needed.\n- Rehydration should occur within 2 hours post-exercise to assure optimal rehydration.\n\n## Hyponatremia Risk\n\n- Overdrinking can increase the risk of hyponatremia (\"water intoxication\"), which in extreme cases has already led to deaths of recreational athletes (triathletes and marathon runners).\n- Four athletes developed water intoxication (hyponatremia) during endurance events lasting more than 7 hours. The etiology of the condition appears to be voluntary hyperhydration with hypotonic solutions combined with moderate sweat sodium chloride losses.\n- Contrary to earlier recommendations such as \"drink before the thirst hits,\" researchers emphasize that athletes should trust their own feeling of thirst, since drinking as required can both minimize the risk of hyponatremia and prevent extreme dehydration.\n- EAH (exercise-associated hyponatremia) can be prevented by avoiding over-hydration, ensuring adequate oral sodium intake, and training athletes focusing on sweat rate and sweat sodium content, exercise intensity, and environmental conditions.\n\n## Electrolyte Guidelines\n\n- The key electrolytes in a sports drink are sodium and chloride, which together form salt. Of the electrolytes in sweat, these two are lost in the greatest amounts during sweating. Including these electrolytes helps replace those lost from sweating, retain consumed fluid, and stimulate thirst.\n- To reduce the risk of hyponatremia during long-duration exercise, runners should consume sodium at concentrations of 500–700 mg/L of fluid. Slightly higher amounts of sodium will be required under conditions of heat (>25°C/77°F) and/or humidity (>60%). When the sweat rate is elevated in such conditions, runners should aim for 300–600 mg/h sodium (1,000–2,000 mg NaCl).\n- Carbohydrates improve the rate of intestinal uptake of sodium, which in turn favors the retention of water.\n- The more you train in the heat, the less sodium you lose because your body learns to conserve sodium (and other electrolytes).\n\n## General Athlete Considerations\n\n- Most fitness exercisers and athletes who train for less than 60–90 minutes a day in normal weather conditions are unlikely to become dehydrated or depleted of electrolytes.\n- However, certain athletes should pay close attention to maintaining proper fluid and electrolyte balance, including long-distance cyclists, marathoners, triathletes, and other endurance athletes who train in the heat for extended periods of time.\n- Fluid requirements in sports are based upon individual sweat rates which can vary considerably both between and within individuals. How much fluid is lost during exercise and how the mineral content of sweat is made up depends on many factors.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"3a0f152a-d69b-47e2-95d1-f2d15e15eb13","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:37:23.565Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"d7b59a29-821a-4b6e-a8e5-e80b5a5bcded"}

For those beyond the 3-hour mark, 60–90 grams per hour should be the goal, with the volume of intake being closer to 90 at 3 hours and 60+ at 4 hours and above.\n\n- **Ultramarathons:** It seems clear from studies of faster ultrarunners that taking in something in the region of 60–90g of carbs per hour is a good starting zone in which to root some trial and error. More recent research has indicated that 120 g/hour at a specific 1:0.8 ratio of glucose to fructose might be more beneficial, perhaps reserved for particularly intense or mountainous sections of the race.\n\n- **Real-world intake often falls short:** Studies suggest that ultra-marathon runners typically consume an average of only 20–40 g/h of CHO during the race. The ISSN nutrition guide for ultra-marathon runners recommends a more realistic target of 30–50 g/h of CHO during the race.\n\n### Why Glucose + Fructose (Multiple Transportable Carbs)?\n\nTypically, the body can absorb about 60 grams of glucose per hour because it uses a specific transporter protein (SGLT1); at higher rates this transporter becomes saturated. However, when combined with other types of carbs like fructose (which uses the GLUT5 transporter) or sucrose (which is broken down into glucose and fructose), the total absorption capacity increases.\n\nBy utilizing these different transport pathways, runners can absorb and use something more in the region of 80–120g of carbohydrates per hour (e.g., 60g glucose and 20–60g fructose), enhancing energy availability, endurance, and performance.\n\n### Optimal Glucose-to-Fructose Ratio\n\nUse a 1:0.8 or 2:1 glucose:fructose ratio to maximize absorption (via dual-transport pathways).\n\n- **For faster runners (sub-2:35 marathon):** Elites are best suited with a 2:1 ratio fuel.\n- **For 3-hour+ runners:** As you drift towards 3 hours and beyond, the ratio falls in line with the 1:1 and 0.8:1 ratios, which is why companies like Maurten settle on these ratios.\n- It has been shown that the 1.0:0.8 ratio oxidized faster than the 1:1 ratio.\n\n### Gut Training\n\nGut training is an important approach for ultra-marathon that aims to improve performance during prolonged exercise by enhancing CHO and fluid intake. Although gastrointestinal symptoms are common during prolonged exercise, gut training can increase gastric emptying rate and improve gastrointestinal comfort and absorption, and in turn allow for increased CHO intake. With increased CHO intake, the amount of sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLT-1) can be increased, improving the oxidation of CHOs during exercise.\n\nGut training has been shown to increase CHO absorption from 90 g/h to up to 120 g/h, reduce post-race neuromuscular fatigue, and decrease muscle damage.\n\n**Practical strategies for gut training include:**\nConsuming high levels of CHO and/or fluid during exercise, increasing the CHO content of the daily diet, exercising immediately after a meal, and simulating race-day nutrition during training.\n\nStart CHO fueling lower (30–40 g/h), progress gradually in gut training to 50–60 g/h using dual fuel blends (glucose:fructose), and favor small, frequent intakes over large boluses to enhance tolerance.\n\n### GI Distress Considerations\n\nGastrointestinal discomfort significantly limits the oxidation rates of exogenous glucose. Exercise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome (EIGS) is commonly observed in endurance athletes, with an incidence ranging from 30% to 90%. The high prevalence of EIGS is attributed to intense training, high-dose carbohydrate supplementation, elevated temperatures, and dehydration.\n\nDual fuel carbohydrates (glucose + fructose) improve absorption through separate intestinal transporters, allowing higher hourly intake without GI distress.\n\n### Elite vs. Amateur Intake\n\nIn ultra races where energy and carbohydrate intake has been analyzed, elite finishers average ~70 g/h, while non-finishers consume <45 g/h.\n\nIt has been observed that faster/elite runners consume more CHO per hour than slower or amateur runners. Over a longer distance (161 km), amateur runners consumed approximately 30 g/h of CHO, whereas higher-level runners consumed 44 ± 33 g/h.\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Target 60–90 g/h** of carbohydrate for marathons and ultras, with potential for **up to 120 g/h** with trained guts and dual-transport carbs.\n2. **Use glucose + fructose** in a **1:0.8 or 2:1 ratio** to maximize absorption and minimize GI issues.\n3. **Train your gut** progressively during training blocks—start at 30–40 g/h and build up.\n4. **Practice race-day nutrition** in training to identify what works for you.\n5. **Higher carb intake correlates with better performance** and race completion, especially in ultras.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"1477f204-4cdc-4d96-9586-5f33cfc489cc","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:37:26.693Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"b3611cb9-94bd-4934-8678-aea46be5a921"}

A systematic review of randomised placebo-controlled studies, including 46 studies in a meta-analysis, found that caffeine has a small but significant effect on endurance performance when taken in moderate doses (3–6 mg/kg), with an overall improvement in mean power output of 2.9 ± 2.2% and a small effect size of 0.22 ± 0.15.\n\nThe point is that taking more than 3–6 mg/kg body mass in most cases provides no greater performance effects.\n\nA newer network meta-analysis (December 2025) found that low-dose capsules (≈3 mg/kg) were the most effective intervention for reducing completion time, followed by moderate-dose capsules and moderate-dose gum. Specifically, low-dose caffeine capsules (≈3 mg/kg) reduced time-trial completion time by 2.2% compared with placebo, outperforming both moderate-dose capsules (1.8%) and moderate-dose gum (1.6%).\n\n### Endurance Performance Benefits\n\nAerobic endurance appears to be the form of exercise with the most consistent moderate-to-large benefits from caffeine use, although the magnitude of its effects differs between individuals.\n\nStudies have shown that caffeine enhances endurance by 2–4% on average across various sports like cycling, running, cross-country skiing, and swimming.\n\n### Timing\n\nThe current recommendation for caffeine supplementation is ingesting ~3–6 mg/kg about 1 hour before the onset of exercise. The intake of caffeine about 1 hour before exercise allows the blockade of adenosine receptors by caffeine, which in turn impedes the fatiguing effects of adenosine during exercise, favoring higher exercise intensity or lower perceived fatigue.\n\nHowever, newer perspectives suggest a more strategic approach: Louise Burke recommends using caffeine as you're starting to feel fatigued, with small doses of caffeine (around 3 mg/kg) tending to work well. In reality, smaller doses tend to be more effective, especially when consumed at the onset of fatigue.\n\n### Habitual Use and Tolerance\n\nThe ISSN Position Stand notes that inter-individual differences in performance as well as adverse effects on sleep or anxiety following caffeine ingestion may be attributed to genetic variation associated with caffeine metabolism, and other factors such as habitual caffeine intake may also play a role in between-individual response variation.\n\nRegarding whether habitual users still benefit:\n\n- In one study, 3 mg/kg caffeine significantly improved exercise performance in trained cyclists (n = 12), irrespective of whether a 4-day withdrawal period was imposed on habitual caffeine users.\n- Another study also reported increased endurance in habitual caffeine users (n = 6) regardless of a 0, 2- or 4-day abstinence period, concluding that improved performance under caffeine conditions at 6 mg/kg is not related to prior caffeine habituation in recreational athletes.\n- While you do develop a tolerance to this drug in many ways, performance improvements are still present in habitual caffeine consumers.\n\nMore recent evidence provides a nuanced picture: Several cross-sectional studies comparing the effects of acute caffeine intake in naïve and habitual caffeine consumers found that both groups experience similar performance benefits from acute doses of 3–6 mg/kg, and a recent systematic review confirmed that habitual caffeine consumption did not influence the acute ergogenic effect of caffeine. However, crossover studies involving participants who underwent controlled habituation to caffeine through daily intake for up to 28 days have shown that caffeine's ergogenic effects are strongest on the first day of consumption, with a diminished response observed as habituation progressed.\n\nThe research on caffeine habituation and performance effects in athletes is \"surprisingly small\" with support for both sides, and limiting caffeine before an event to \"get more from your caffeine\" is not particularly helpful, according to Dr. Burke.\n\n### Practical Recommendations\n\nLow-dose caffeine regimens are also associated with fewer adverse effects (e.g., palpitations, insomnia, gastrointestinal discomfort), and accordingly, low-dose caffeine capsules represent the most practical supplementation strategy for endurance athletes.\n\nThe optimal dose range is 3–6 mg/kg, taken 30–60 minutes before training or competition. Gum or lozenge formulations work faster; habitual use may slightly reduce effects, though most benefits appear even in habitual caffeine users.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"45ee189a-c2e5-4da0-87cf-43c493795af9","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:38:18.174Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"3ed8c7c1-9e47-48e4-9613-4a5b17018a08"}

Along with your taper, an increase in the proportion of carbohydrates in your diet will help your muscles to do this before race day. Research shows that as few as two to three days of carbohydrate loading in addition to rest (tapering) can optimize glycogen stores. One of the easiest ways is to make sure your mileage is low the week before your marathon, and focus on increasing your carbohydrate intake two to three days before your race.\n\nAim for 8–10g carb/kg body weight over the course of the two days leading up to race day. Rather than trying to consume all these carbs during your three big meals, which might leave you feeling lethargic, it's best to spread them more evenly across the day. When carb-loading, the best thing to do is to focus on increasing the proportion of carbs in each meal.\n\n### Fiber Reduction\nTwo to three days out from race day, reduce high-fiber and fried foods, eliminate spicy foods, uncooked meat, and unfamiliar foods to minimize the chance of GI distress, diarrhea, and bloating.\n\nAt this point, it's worth starting to favour simpler carbohydrates instead of those higher in fiber, such as high volumes of vegetables, whole grains, and cereals. Without getting into details, consuming too much fiber ahead of your race could have an impact on your bowels, so try to limit your intake a little to prevent this situation on race day!\n\nPractical fiber-reduction swaps include: swapping oatmeal for Rice Krispie cereal, swapping brown for white rice, swapping bagels for sliced white bread, and bran flakes for rice cakes. These simple swaps, while also reducing vegetables and prioritizing nitrate-rich options, can reduce fiber.\n\n### The Night Before the Race\nInstead of the traditional heavy pasta dinner, try eating your main pre-race meal for lunch the day before your race. This ensures you have enough time to digest that food. Then, try a lighter carbohydrate-rich dinner and a carbohydrate snack before bed.\n\nThere is no reason to consume a huge plate or two of pasta at dinner the night before the race. Overindulging before bedtime might disrupt sleep and can leave you feeling bloated on race morning. It's best to finish this last meal by 5:00–6:00 pm (earlier if possible), keep it bland, LOW in fat, low in fiber, and moderate protein.\n\n### Hydration & Sodium Loading\nIncrease sodium intake by adding salt to foods and eating salty foods. Prioritize hydration but don't go overboard. Monitor the color of your urine to assess hydration status throughout the week. Optimally it should be light yellow and not clear.\n\nAcute sodium loading is most effective and has the fewest adverse side effects 12–15 hours out from the race start.\n\n---\n\n## Race Morning Protocol\n\n### Breakfast Timing\nAim for breakfast 2.5–3 hours before race start to allow plenty of time for digestion. Regardless of the duration of your event, intentionally skipping breakfast is not a wise move. Research shows that eating before a race improves performance.\n\nDuring the night, liver glycogen is responsible for maintaining blood sugars and fueling the body's work of repairing and rebuilding while you sleep. However, by morning, your liver glycogen is half full at best. Therefore, it's critical to restock carbohydrates to support performance.\n\n### Pre-Race Meal Composition\nYour pre-race meal should include 1–2g carbs/kg body weight (for example: a 69kg runner should consume 69–138g of carbs at this meal). The intake of 1–4 g/kg body mass of carbohydrate 3–4 hours before the race is recommended to top off muscle glycogen content after the overnight fast.\n\nBreakfast should be mainly carbohydrates with a small amount of protein, and a very limited amount of fat since fat takes the longest to digest and can lead to GI issues. Focus on easily digestible carbs like oatmeal topped with banana, blueberry, or honey. Avoid high-fiber foods like bran cereals or raw vegetables on race day, as they can cause digestive issues.\n\n### Pre-Race Snack\n15–30 minutes before your race is a good time to once again top off your carbohydrate stores. A banana, small serving of pretzels, or an engineered product, like gels or chews, can maintain blood sugar levels while topping off your glycogen.\n\n### If You Have Pre-Race Jitters\nIf pre-race jitters get the best of you, try taking small bites but don't force it, and opt for breakfast in liquid form as it will clear the gut faster than solids and provide hydration. (Think smoothies!)\n\n### Fluids on Race Morning\nDo NOT chug your liquids. If you overdo it on fluids the morning of your race, you risk misbalancing electrolytes, which could lead to muscle cramps. Ensure proper hydration the days leading up to your race and use the morning of to top off stores.\n\n---\n\n## Key Research Finding\nStudies show that marathon runners often fail to meet carbohydrate intake pre-competition recommendations (averaging only 1g ± 0.5g/kg vs. the recommended 1–4g/kg). A similar under-fueling pattern has been reported in trail running and middle-distance triathlon.\n\n### Golden Rules\n- Race week is not the time to experiment with new foods or supplements. These can often cause unwanted side effects, so stick to what you know works for you.\n- Practice makes perfect. Your long runs during training are the best time to test your pre-race meals.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"35aa36d1-e35c-4b23-9e6d-08e021a09c35","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:38:29.642Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"29685026-e37e-46e3-a9bf-f814e3c479a7"}

The ACSM states that nitrate is likely beneficial for medium-duration endurance performance, while creatine benefits very short-duration high-intensity efforts.\n\nInternational authorities such as the Australian Institute of Sport classify caffeine, creatine, β-alanine, nitrate sources (e.g., beetroot juice), and sodium bicarbonate as Group A supplements, meaning there is strong evidence for their performance-enhancing effects.\n\n### 2. **Beetroot Juice / Dietary Nitrate**\n\nHigh nitrate-containing foods include leafy green and root vegetables, including beetroot. Acute performance benefits are generally seen within 2–3 hours following a nitrate bolus of 5–9 mmol (310–560 mg).\n\nNitrate supplementation has been associated with improvements of 4–25% in exercise time to exhaustion and 1–3% in sport-specific time-trial performances lasting under 40 minutes. It may enhance type II muscle fiber function, resulting in 3–5% improvement in high-intensity intermittent exercise.\n\nHowever, for elite athletes the picture is more nuanced: Acute beetroot juice supplementation (70–140 ml containing 6.5–8.0 mmol nitrate) showed limited benefits in elite athletes, suggesting that highly-trained individuals might require different dosing strategies.\n\nDietary nitrate, popularized by nitrate-rich beetroot juice, has been shown to enhance exercise economy and endurance performance, although its effect size is modest.\n\n### 3. **Creatine**\n\nCreatine loading can acutely enhance the performance of sports involving repeated high-intensity exercise, as well as the chronic outcomes of training programs. Supplementation increases muscle creatine stores, augmenting the rate of phosphocreatine resynthesis.\n\nThe recommended loading-phase is approximately 20 g/day divided into 4 equal daily doses for 5–7 days, followed by a maintenance-phase of 3–5 g/day.\n\nA potential limitation for runners: A potential 1–2 kg body mass increase after creatine loading (primarily from water retention) may be detrimental for endurance performance or in events where body mass must be moved against gravity.\n\nFor maximizing anaerobic peak power, protein and creatine appear to be the most practical and evidence-supported supplements.\n\n### 4. **Beta-Alanine**\n\nβ-Alanine increases muscle carnosine, which buffers intramuscular pH decline during high-intensity exercise. This helps delay fatigue in efforts lasting from approximately 30 seconds up to a few minutes.\n\nBeta-alanine supplementation using a progressive loading protocol (4.8 g/day for the first 10 days, increasing to 6.4 g/day for the final 18 days) demonstrated significant improvements in power output and performance metrics.\n\nIn elite populations, beta-alanine demonstrated sport-specific benefits, while caffeine (3–6 mg/kg) consistently improved power output and technical performance.\n\n### 5. **Iron**\n\nIron is critical for runners, particularly female endurance athletes:\n\nIron facilitates key biological functions underpinning sports performance, and up to 60% of female athletes experience iron deficiency.\n\nIron deficiency negatively affects endurance performance by 3%–4%. However, endurance performance improved by 2%–20% when iron-deficient athletes were treated with 100 mg/day of elemental iron for up to 56 days via oral supplementation, or bi-daily via parenteral administration over 8–10 days.\n\nIron-deficient non-anemic athletes with low serum ferritin stores may be predisposed to reduced maximal aerobic capacity. However, maximal aerobic capacity improved by 6%–15% following 16–100 mg/day of elemental iron for 36–126 days.\n\nEndurance athletes are a frequently studied group when it comes to iron deficiency, because of iron's role in aerobic metabolism and the high prevalence of iron deficiency in endurance athletes.\n\nIron deficiency is common in physically active individuals and particularly exacerbated in professional athletes. Athletes are prone to iron loss due to prolonged physical activity. Elite athletes engaged in extremely physiologically demanding sports like marathon running commonly exhibit decreased haemoglobin concentrations.\n\n### 6. **Vitamin D**\n\nDeficiency in vitamin D has been shown to increase the risk of injury. Research has investigated its effects on aerobic capacity, anaerobic measures, serum biomarkers of inflammation, and bone health.\n\nOf three studies assessing aerobic capacity, two demonstrated significantly greater improvements in maximal oxygen uptake in supplemented versus nonsupplemented athletes. Measurements of anaerobic power and strength were consistently increased in supplemented groups in 5 out of the studies reviewed.\n\nLow vitamin D levels have been demonstrated to have negative effects on muscle strength, power, and endurance; increase stress fractures and other musculoskeletal injuries. The recommended serum level of 25(OH)D is > 32 ng/mL and the preferred level is > 40 ng/mL.\n\nVitamin D supplementation has been linked to improved athletic performance, particularly in athletes with low initial vitamin D status. However, the impact is influenced by individual characteristics, exercise type, and dosage/duration of supplementation.\n\nA 2024 meta-analysis found: The pooled analysis suggested that overall strength tests demonstrated no significant improvement from vitamin D3 supplementation (SMD 0.18, p = 0.08). This suggests that benefit is primarily seen in correcting deficiencies rather than boosting already-sufficient athletes.\n\n### 7. **Tart Cherry Juice**\n\nMontmorency tart cherries have received considerable attention for their potential application in the recovery process following various forms of exercise, including long-distance running, cycling, repeated sprints, and sport-specific training.\n\nTart cherry supplementation has been shown to reduce muscle soreness, accelerate recovery, and support performance following high-intensity training.\n\nTart cherry lessens pain and accelerates strength recovery after exercise and decreases blood markers of inflammation/oxidative stress. These improvements occur in both strength and endurance exercise.\n\nHowever, there are important caveats: A daily high dose of antioxidants may blunt training adaptations. Tart cherry juice should be consumed when recovery is essential, not when building training adaptations.\n\nIn the lead-up to a race, experts recommend drinking 8 to 12 ounces of juice or 1 ounce of concentrate for four to five days prior.\n\n### Key Guiding Principles\n\nPerformance-enhancing supplements should be considered only where a strong evidence base supports their use as safe, legal, and effective, ideally after adequacy of sports nutrition dietary practices is ensured. Supplements should be trialled thoroughly by the athlete in training before committing to use in competition.\n\nSupplements do not make athletes and do not replace training. Before reaching for pills and potions, optimize your training load and dial in your sleep, nutrition, and rest. Always aim to nail your daily nutrition habits first, then layer specific sports nutrition, and then consider supplements.\n\nThere is limited knowledge around combining multiple supplements. Supplement combinations have the potential to produce additive, neutral, or counteractive outcomes.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"5a702b3d-a8c9-4ccf-ba9e-0cf51a0d60af","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:38:42.923Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"16021937-874a-4e24-b553-bf184454a6b0"}

Sodium intake is recommended when exercise duration exceeds 2 hours.\n\nHeavy sweaters may need 700 mg or more of sodium for every liter of fluid consumed during a marathon, while lighter sweaters may only need around 300–500 mg for every liter of fluid.\n\nSome athletes need even more sodium, perhaps even up to 2,300 mg per hour, depending on their individual sweat composition.\n\n### Sweat Sodium Concentration Variability\n\nResearch shows enormous individual variation in sweat sodium concentration among marathon runners:\n\n- As a group of 157 marathoners, sweat Na⁺ concentration was 42.9 ± 18.7 mmol/L (minimal-maximal value = 7.0–95.5 mmol/L).\n- Some runners lose 350 mg sodium per liter of sweat, while some lose 1,800 mg sodium per liter of sweat.\n- Runners can be classified as low-salt sweaters (<30 mmol/L), typical sweaters (≥30 and <60 mmol/L), and salty sweaters (≥60 mmol/L of sweat Na⁺ concentration).\n\n### Sweat Rate Variability\n\nOn average, sweat rate was 1.1±0.6 litres/hour, sweat sodium concentration was 36±11 mmol/L, and sweat sodium loss was 42±28 mmol/hour (equivalent to 1.0±0.6 grams/hour).\n\nThese variables show dramatic variability, with sweat rates ranging from ~0.2 to ~5.5 L/hour, sweat sodium concentrations ~10 to ~90 mmol/L, and sodium losses ranging 0.07 to 7.8 grams/h.\n\n### What Actual Marathoners Consume vs. Recommendations\n\nIn a study of the Seville Marathon, the average sodium intake during competition was 192 ± 150 mg/h, which is below the recommended levels.\n\n### Factors Affecting Sodium Needs\n\nThe amount of sodium lost in sweat varies greatly for each person. Heavy, salty sweaters need more than those who do not sweat as much. Temperature during training and racing also plays a role, as runners need more sodium in warmer, more humid conditions.\n\nYour fitness level can influence sweat rate and composition, with untrained runners losing more sweat and electrolytes than those who are more trained.\n\n### Risks of Inadequate Sodium\n\nExercise-associated hyponatremia occurs when plasma sodium concentration is <135 mmol/L. This can occur during or after prolonged exercise for 4 to 6 hours or more.\n\nDrinking too much water without taking in enough sodium during long runs can cause hyponatremia, which happens when there is not enough sodium in your blood. Signs include headache, nausea, trouble with balance, confusion, and in rare cases, seizures or coma.\n\n### Practical Takeaways\n\nFor runs between 1–3 hours: use a hydration mix and gels or real food options during the run (400–500 mg of sodium per hour).\n\nOnly a lab test can show exactly how much salt is lost in your sweat, so individualized testing (such as sweat patch analysis) is the gold standard for dialing in personal sodium needs on race day.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"8606862f-65ac-4704-a64b-27fd56253c69","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:39:16.465Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"bbb6e37e-0e29-4af4-88cd-d59567c838d3"}

Several formulas are commonly used:\n\n**Harris-Benedict Equation (Revised):**\n- Men: **88.362 + (13.397 × weight in kg) + (4.799 × height in cm) − (5.677 × age in years)**\nWomen: **447.593 + (9.247 × weight in kg) + (3.098 × height in cm) − (4.330 × age in years)**\n\n**Mifflin-St Jeor Equation** (often recommended for endurance athletes):\n- Men: BMR = 10 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) − 5 × age (years) + 5\nWomen: BMR = 10 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) − 5 × age (years) − 161\n\n**Ten Haaf Equation** (designed specifically for endurance athletes):\n- Energy need in rest per day = (11.936 × weight in kg) + (587.728 × height in m) − (8.129 × age in years) + (191.027 × sex [M=1, F=0]) + 29.279\n\n**Katch-McArdle Formula:**\n- This equation takes things further by incorporating body fat percentage and is particularly valuable for athletes, bodybuilders, or anyone with higher lean body mass.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate TDEE Using Activity Multipliers\n\nYour TDEE is an estimation of how many calories you burn per day when exercise is taken into account. It's calculated by first figuring out your BMR, then multiplying that value by an activity multiplier to account for the calories you burn during the day.\n\n**Standard Activity Multipliers:**\n\n| Activity Level | Multiplier |\n|---|---|\n| Sedentary (little or no exercise) | BMR × 1.2 |\n| Lightly active (1–3 days/week) | BMR × 1.375 |\n| Moderately active (3–5 days/week) | BMR × 1.55 |\n| Very active (6–7 days/week) | BMR × 1.725 |\n| Extra active (very hard exercise + physical job) | BMR × 1.9 |\n| Professional athlete | BMR × 2.3 |\n\nAthletes typically multiply BMR by 1.55–1.9 to calculate TDEE, compared to 1.2–1.4 for sedentary individuals. Furthermore, research by the International Society of Sports Nutrition suggests elite endurance athletes may require multipliers up to 2.3 during peak training phases.\n\n### Step 3: Add Sport-Specific Adjustments for Runners\n\nEndurance athletes typically need 10–15% more calories than strength athletes due to prolonged aerobic activity.\n\n**Running-Specific Calorie Burn:**\n- Calories burned while running = MET × weight (kg) × duration (hours). For example, a 70 kg runner: 10 × 70 × 1 = 700 kcal burned during one hour of running.\n- For most runners, the result is around 0.9–1 kcal per kg of body weight per km traveled, meaning a 70 kg person often burns ~70 kcal per km.\n- We burn approximately 100 calories per mile when running, although this can vary between individuals due to weight, muscle mass, and exercise efficiency.\n\n### Alternative Quick Method\n\nFor a quick estimate: calculate basal needs by multiplying the athlete's weight × 10 (in pounds), add 20–30% for basic activity, then add 100 calories for every 10 minutes of hard exercise. For example, a 220-pound athlete training hard for three hours would need approximately 4,400–4,660 calories per day.\n\n### Real-World Calorie Ranges for Runners\n\n- Elite marathoners may burn 100 calories per mile, requiring 3,000–4,000 daily calories during peak training.\n- An elite marathon runner with a running training volume of around 100 miles/week would require an average daily calorie intake of 3,500–4,000 calories.\n- Marathon runners and cyclists may need 3,000–5,000+ calories daily during heavy training.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\nDon't forget the Specific Dynamic Action of Food (SDA) — calculated by multiplying the total of BMR and EEPA by 10% — which accounts for the thermic effect of food.\n\nIt's important to remember that prolonged or intense exercise will significantly increase BMR, and this often remains elevated for several hours after exercise. So it's not always enough to simply calculate BMR and add on the energy expenditure from exercise.\n\n### Macronutrient Ratios for Endurance Athletes\n\nUnlike general population recommendations, athletes require adjusted macronutrient ratios: Protein at 1.6–2.2g per kg body weight for muscle recovery, Carbohydrates at 45–65% of calories for training fuel and glycogen replenishment, and Fats at 20–35% for hormone production and cellular function.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Formula:**\n> **TDEE = BMR × Activity Multiplier (+ sport-specific adjustment of ~10–15% for endurance athletes)**\n\nAll of these calculations are estimates; calculating precisely the diet's energy value can be problematic, as the difference between dietary reference intake for an athlete may exceed 2,000 kcal a day depending on the method used. Monitoring weight trends over time is the best way to fine-tune your intake.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"57e6151b-4620-4dc5-9219-2155b7f471d5","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:39:27.023Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"7cadae5f-f033-40a2-a484-e4337cfaa559"}

Solid Carbs for Race Day Fueling\",\"url\":\"https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/what-kind-of-carbohydrates-to-eat-during-your-race-liquids-vs-solids/\"}]\n\nHere's a comprehensive summary of what the research and expert advice says about marathon fueling timing and the comparison of gels vs. liquid vs. solid fuel sources:\n\n## When to Start Fueling During a Marathon\n\nAs a general rule, start fueling during runs that last 90 minutes or longer. More specifically for race day, \"For most people, start to fuel 30 to 45 minutes into the run to get a head start on your glycogen storage.\" Some sources recommend even earlier — take a gel within the first 20–30 minutes of the run.\n\n### Pre-Race Fueling\nEven if you ate a pre-race meal (which you should for peak performance), both research and practice demonstrate the benefit of taking one gel 15 minutes before the race start. A pre-race gel raises your blood glucose before the race, which is beneficial if you are burning off energy with pre-race nerves. Plus, a gel before the race brings some blood flow into your gut before you get running, which may be favorable for gastric emptying and reducing the risk of GI upset during the race itself.\n\nYou should avoid delaying your carbohydrate intake until you start feeling tired and should start early on in the race with regular feedings every 15 to 30 minutes as preferred.\n\n## How Much to Consume\n\n\"The general idea is to start with consuming 30 to 60 grams of carbohydrates per hour,\" which is the range our bodies can absorb glucose and varies slightly depending on how big you are, how fast you're running, and how quickly you're burning through your calories.\n\nElite marathoners regularly consume 90–120g of carbs per hour during races, but this doesn't happen overnight. This large amount of carbohydrate must contain fructose as well as glucose, as 90g per hour of glucose cannot be absorbed and will lead to gastrointestinal trouble. Therefore it is best to use a multiple transportable carbohydrate such as 2:1 glucose-to-fructose as your carbohydrate source.\n\n## Gel vs. Liquid vs. Solid: What the Research Says\n\n### Key Finding: No Major Physiological Difference\nA 2011 review study by researchers in the UK, Australia, and China emphasizes that no carbohydrate source—gel, solid, or liquid—has a distinct physiological performance advantage. However, the practical differences matter:\n\n### Gels\n- Gels are simply one of the easiest ways to take carbs during a marathon. A gel is a concentrated semi-solid formula that allows you to consume a large amount of carbohydrates without chewing. The gel formula packs a lot of carbs into a small amount, so that your stomach doesn't become jostled from a large volume of food.\n- Gels and solids are much more energy-dense than sports drinks, making it a lot more manageable to hit high levels of carbohydrate intake. Always take energy gels with water, never alone and never with Gatorade. Without water, energy gels will take longer to digest and enter the blood stream.\n- One study found that between 10 and 20 percent of runners will have serious gastrointestinal problems like nausea, cramps, bloating, and diarrhea when using carbohydrate gels.\n\n### Liquid (Sports Drinks)\n- Elite marathoners often rely on liquid carbohydrates, but most recreational runners find it easier to use gels or a combination of products.\n- Sports drinks provide carbohydrates, electrolytes, and fluid all in one convenient beverage. Even if you use gels during a marathon, you will benefit from having a sports drink for the fluid and sodium.\n- Experts generally recommend \"decoupling\" your fuel from your hydration, so you can manage your carb and fluid intake separately.\n\n### Solids\n- In cycling studies, solid bars did just as well as liquids. Similarly, gels did just as well as liquids too — at least for cyclists.\n- However, for high-impact exercise like running, only half of triathletes in one study were able to complete three hours of hard exercise with liquids only, but just nine of the triathletes could handle the same workout once solids were added in. And even the ones who didn't finish the workout weren't able to go as hard.\n- Chews offer variety and a solid option if gels don't agree with your stomach. Chewing takes more effort, so use them on easier sections of your run.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Aim to start gut training 8–10 weeks before race day. If one gel per hour feels tough now, start there and work up gradually. Practice fueling at race pace to get your gut used to it.\n- No matter what the guidelines say, it's nearly impossible for anyone besides you to know exactly what your body needs. That's why practicing your fueling techniques on long runs prior to your race is so important. Figure out what your stomach can handle, what you personally like to eat and drink, and how it makes you feel.\n- In general, it's a good idea to take down a gel every 30 to 40 minutes.\n\n**Bottom line:** Start fueling early (within 20–45 minutes), aim for 30–60g of carbs per hour (more experienced runners can go higher), and choose whichever format—gel, liquid, or solid—that your stomach tolerates best, since the research shows no significant performance difference between forms. That said, gels and liquids tend to be more practical and better tolerated during running than solid foods.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"4e757d09-4dbe-41d9-9306-1170363ecc72","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:39:34.013Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"fb9a08b5-6b5f-49bc-8b3c-6b92f932dab9"}

This 90-minute threshold is the key factor in determining whether carb loading is beneficial for a given race.\n\n### For Marathons: Strong Evidence\n\nResearch shows a 2–3% performance boost from carb loading, and one study found that properly carb-loaded marathoners ran 14% faster than those who didn't — potentially 20+ minutes for many recreational runners. Research has also shown that carb loading effectively can prolong exercise capacity by up to 20%, and has improved time trial performance by 2–3% in high-intensity events lasting more than 60 minutes.\n\n### For Half Marathons: It Depends on Your Finish Time\n\nFor half marathons, whether carb loading helps depends on your finish time. If you're crossing the line in under 90 minutes, you probably don't need to carb load. Running 1:45 or slower? Consider a modified 2–3 day protocol with increased carbs in the final 24 hours.\n\nCarb loading is considered necessary for runners who are running for longer than 90 minutes. If your half marathon time is going to be less than 90 minutes, then you may not need to carb load. Additionally, runners who are running shorter distances such as a 10K or 5K do not need to carb load, as their times will not exceed 90 minutes of running.\n\n### For 5Ks and 10Ks: Not Necessary\n\nFor 5Ks and 10Ks, runners should skip carb loading entirely. Normal glycogen stores can fuel 90 minutes of running, meaning most runners never tap out during these shorter races. Just eat normally, stay hydrated, and have a decent race-morning breakfast.\n\nCarb loading is not necessary for shorter races like 5Ks or 10Ks, as it is unlikely you will use up the glycogen stored in your muscles within the time it takes to complete those races.\n\n### How to Carb Load Properly (When It's Warranted)\n\nResearch shows adequate carbohydrates to fully load glycogen stores are 10–12 g/kg for 2 days or 8 g/kg for 3 days.\n\nThe evidence suggests that highly trained athletes don't need to go through a depletion phase; improved physical fitness is an additional stimulus for enhanced muscle glycogen stores. These athletes just need to eat a greater proportion of carbohydrate for about 2–3 days before a race. The combination of eating more carbohydrate, coupled with a reduction in training (tapering) in the final days before competition, enables muscles to boost glycogen levels.\n\nGiven that a half marathon is shorter and can often be run at a higher intensity than a full marathon, the carb loading strategy may not need to be as aggressive. Full marathoners might start their carb load earlier and aim for the higher end of the carb intake spectrum.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n| Race Distance | Carb Loading? |\n|---|---|\n| 5K / 10K | **Not needed** — normal glycogen stores are sufficient |\n| Half Marathon (< 90 min) | **Likely not needed** |\n| Half Marathon (> 90 min) | **Modified approach recommended** (2–3 days) |\n| Marathon | **Essential** — strongest evidence of benefit |\n\nIt is generally considered beneficial to carb load for any race lasting over 90–120 minutes. The bottom line is that the value of carb loading is directly tied to whether your race duration will exceed your body's glycogen capacity, and you should always practice your protocol during training before using it on race day.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"5ba93057-3031-4869-b073-97baa1b53004","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:40:06.582Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"db5f90a5-ab6f-4f76-a622-0749acac60f5"}

Despite the vast body of research, there remains much controversy and disagreement between researchers over the real effects of hydration status on performance.\n\n### The \"Drink to Thirst\" Position (Tim Noakes et al.)\n\nIn 2012 Dr. Tim Noakes published a controversial book titled *Waterlogged—The Serious Problem of Overhydration in Endurance Sports*. Noakes was motivated by years spent studying instances of athletes becoming very sick or even dying from the overconsumption of water (and diluted sports drinks) during competition.\n\nNoakes contends that drinking water \"to thirst\" (instead of using a pre-determined strategy or consuming supplementary sodium) is not only the best way to avoid hyponatremia, but also to maximize athletic performance. He cites anecdotal examples from the early 1900s and into the 1970s, when athletes were actively discouraged from drinking during marathons, yet performed very well.\n\nSupporting this view, no study found that drinking more than ad libitum during exercise produced any biological advantage, but it could cause exercise-associated hyponatremia. Drinking ad libitum appears to optimize performance and safety during exercise in many situations.\n\nUltra-running studies examining ad libitum drinking concluded that this strategy led to no incidences of hyponatremia, did not impact performance despite body mass losses >3%, and concluded that drinking beyond thirst is not required to maintain hydration during ultra-endurance events.\n\n### The \"Planned Drinking\" Position\n\nOn the other side, dehydration of ≥2% body mass is associated with impaired thermoregulatory function, elevated cardiovascular strain and, in many conditions (e.g., warmer, longer, more intense), impaired aerobic exercise performance.\n\nA total of 41 of 60 observations (68%) were significantly impaired by dehydration ≥2% body mass. Independent of p value, the number of studies reporting a reduction in performance for endurance exercise of ≥2% body mass loss was 53 of 60 negative observations, or 88%.\n\n---\n\n## Key Limitations of Thirst as a Guide\n\nIn humans, thirst tends to be alleviated before complete rehydration is achieved. When sweating rates are high and ad libitum fluid consumption is not sufficient to replace sweat losses, a cumulative loss in body water results.\n\nPost-event ratings of thirst were not significantly correlated with any measured variable, including total fluid intake, body mass index, height, ground speed, body water balance, and change of body mass. In other words, the intensity of thirst did not represent the degree of dehydration or the volume of fluid consumed.\n\nOne study suggests that the effects of dehydration are not explained by perceived thirst, but it does not answer the question of whether thirst affects performance. It is likely that thirst plays an important role, but it seems likely to be only part of the picture, as performance decrements were observed even when thirst was absent.\n\n---\n\n## Where Each Strategy Works Best\n\nResearch suggests a **context-dependent** approach:\n\nCircumstances where drinking to thirst may be sufficient include short duration exercise of <1 hour to 90 min; exercise in cooler conditions; and lower-intensity exercise.\n\nCircumstances where planned drinking is optimal include longer duration activities of >90 min, particularly in the heat; higher-intensity exercise with high sweat rates; exercise where performance is a concern; and when carbohydrate intake of 1 g/min is desired.\n\nThere's evidence that a pre-planned hydration strategy may be more effective for those engaging in very high intensity, medium duration (i.e., ~1–3 hours) endurance events where maintenance of blood volume is critical to support very high levels of performance.\n\nOne reason \"drinking water to thirst\" might not always work is because sweat contains relatively large, and quite variable, levels of electrolytes, so prolonged sweating can deplete the body of these finite reserves. This is most likely to be the case during ultra-distance events, where total sweat losses can be significant over a long period of time, especially in the heat.\n\n---\n\n## Methodological Concerns in the Literature\n\nWhile much research has examined the effect of dehydration on endurance athletes over the past century, there is still much debate. Studies may be, at least partially, confounded by 1) not being blinded, introducing the potential for placebo and nocebo effects on performance, and 2) using uncomfortable dehydration methods that may influence performance outside of any effect of dehydration.\n\nOne general criticism of the endurance exercise/dehydration studies is that they were conducted in a laboratory. Valid criticisms include achievement of dehydration before (rather than during) exercise and unrealistically low air flow rates. However, a review of dehydration studies where water loss occurred during exercise reported the same conclusions.\n\n---\n\n## Emerging Consensus\n\nThe current evidence suggests that a personalized approach to hydration is necessary to start exercise in a euhydrated state, prevent excessive dehydration (losses greater than 2–3% body mass), and replenish fluids post-exercise. Fluid needs vary based on individual sweat rates, exercise intensity, duration, and environmental conditions.\n\nDrinking water to thirst is not inherently \"wrong.\" In fact it's probably the correct thing to do a lot of the time. However, when sweating over many hours and accumulating large sweat and sodium losses in a condensed period of time, there is too much solid evidence out there showing athletes at all levels using electrolyte supplements to very positive effect.\n\nEach athlete can select the rehydration method that best allows her/him to achieve a hydration middle ground between dehydration and overhydration, to optimize physical performance, and reduce the risk of illness.\n\nIn summary, the debate is far from settled, but the weight of evidence increasingly favors a **flexible, individualized strategy** that uses thirst as one input among several — particularly for longer, hotter, and more intense events where planned drinking may offer meaningful performance benefits.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"999d2145-eda5-48f7-8f92-047565cf7f74","timestamp":"2026-02-14T17:40:28.008Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"55439624-e48a-4923-8b17-d6edf92b65d0"}

Daily Nutrition for Runners\n\n### Macronutrient Guidelines by Training Volume\n\n| Training Volume | Carbohydrate (g/kg/day) | Protein (g/kg/day) | Fat (% of calories) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Light activity (30-60 min/day) | 3-5 | 1.2-1.4 | 25-35% |\n| Moderate training (1-2 hr/day) | 5-7 | 1.4-1.6 | 20-35% |\n| High volume (2-3 hr/day) | 6-10 | 1.6-1.8 | 20-35% |\n| Extreme volume (4-5+ hr/day, ultra training) | 8-12 | 1.6-2.0 | 20-35% |\n\n**Key authority references**: The ACSM, IOC, and ISSN converge on 1.4-2.0 g/kg/day protein and 3-12 g/kg/day carbohydrate depending on training load. Fat should constitute at least 20% of total calories to support hormone production and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.\n\n### Carbohydrate Periodization (\"Train Low, Compete High\")\n\n**Concept**: Deliberately training with reduced carbohydrate availability to enhance endurance-related metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle, while ensuring full carbohydrate availability for key workouts and competitions.\n\n**Strategies**:\n- **Fasted training**: Easy runs in the morning after overnight fast (liver glycogen reduced, muscle glycogen largely intact)\n- **Sleep low, train low**: Train in the afternoon/evening, withhold carbohydrates overnight, train again the next morning in a glycogen-depleted state\n- **Fuel for the work required**: Adjust carbohydrate availability meal-by-meal and day-by-day based on the session's intensity and purpose\n\n**What the evidence shows**:\n- 73% of studies show augmented cell signaling with train-low approaches\n- 75% show enhanced gene expression related to mitochondrial biogenesis\n- 78% show increased oxidative enzyme activity/protein content\n- However, only 37% of studies measuring performance outcomes showed improvement; 63% showed no change\n- A 2021 JISSN meta-analysis found no overall effect of carbohydrate periodization on endurance performance versus high-carb controls\n- A 2024 study (Prieto-Bellver et al.) found no between-group differences in highly trained cyclists\n\n**Practical application**: Apply train-low for 30-50% of sessions (easy/low-intensity only). Always fuel fully for key workouts, races, and high-intensity sessions. The glycogen threshold hypothesis suggests post-training glycogen should be below 300 mmol/kg dry weight but not below 100 mmol/kg (below which muscle protein synthesis may be impaired).\n\n**What elite runners actually do**: East African distance runners habitually eat a high-carbohydrate diet to support their high training loads, while incorporating some incidental train-low sessions (e.g., fasted morning runs).\n\n### Protein Timing and Amounts for Recovery\n\n**Per-dose recommendations (ISSN Position Stand)**:\n- 0.25-0.40 g/kg body mass per dose (absolute: 20-40 g per serving)\n- Every 3-4 hours throughout the day\n- Each dose should contain 700-3,000 mg leucine plus a balanced array of essential amino acids\n\n**Post-run recovery**:\n- If rapid glycogen restoration is required (< 4 hours between sessions): combine carbohydrate (0.8 g/kg/h) with protein (0.2-0.4 g/kg/h)\n- When carbohydrate intake is suboptimal (< 1.2 g/kg/h), adding protein enhances glycogen recovery\n- The \"anabolic window\" is broader than commonly believed -- the anabolic effect of exercise lasts at least 24 hours but diminishes with increasing time post-exercise\n\n**Pre-sleep protein**: 30-40 g of casein protein before bed increases overnight muscle protein synthesis and metabolic rate without affecting fat breakdown.\n\n### Caloric Needs Estimation\n\n**Step 1 -- Calculate BMR** (Mifflin-St Jeor, recommended for athletes):\n- Men: BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age) + 5\n- Women: BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age) - 161\n\n**Step 2 -- Apply activity multiplier**:\n- Moderately active runner (3-5 days/week): BMR x 1.55\n- Very active runner (6-7 days/week): BMR x 1.725\n- Peak training / high-mileage: BMR x 1.9-2.3\n\n**Running-specific approximation**: ~1 kcal per kg of body weight per km traveled (e.g., a 70 kg runner burns approximately 70 kcal per km, or roughly 100 kcal per mile).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Carb Loading\n\n### Protocols by Race Distance\n\n| Race Distance | Carb Loading Needed? | Protocol |\n|---|---|---|\n| 5K / 10K | No | Normal glycogen stores sufficient for < 90 min of effort |\n| Half marathon (< 90 min finish) | Likely not needed | Normal diet with carb-focused pre-race meal |\n| Half marathon (> 90 min finish) | Modified approach | 7-8 g/kg/day for 1-2 days before race |\n| Marathon | Essential | 8-12 g/kg/day for 2-3 days before race |\n| Ultramarathon | Essential | 10-12 g/kg/day for 2-3 days before race |\n\n### Classic vs. Modified Carb Loading\n\n**Classic protocol (Bergstrom, 1960s)** -- now considered outdated:\n- 3-4 days of glycogen-depleting exercise + low-carb diet\n- Followed by 3-4 days of high-carb diet (8-12 g/kg/day)\n- Risks: fatigue, mood disturbance, injury during depletion phase\n\n**Modern/modified protocol** -- current recommendation:\n- No depletion phase required\n- Taper training volume while increasing carbohydrates to 8-12 g/kg/day for 2-3 days\n- Well-trained athletes may achieve full glycogen stores in as little as 24-36 hours\n- Performance improvement: 2-3% in controlled studies, up to 20% in exercise capacity tests\n\n### Practical Carb Loading Guidelines\n\n**Target**: 8-10 g/kg/day (up to 12 g/kg/day for some athletes). For a 70 kg runner, that equals 560-840 g of carbs per day.\n\n**Timing**: Start 2-3 days before race. If racing Sunday, begin Thursday or Friday.\n\n**Preferred food sources** (low-fiber, easily digestible):\n- White rice, white bread, white pasta\n- Pancakes, bagels, rice cakes\n- Bananas, fruit bars, fruit leather\n- Sports drinks, gels, energy bars\n- Maple syrup, honey, jam\n\n**Expected weight gain**: 1-2 kg from glycogen + water storage (each gram of glycogen is stored with 3 g of water). Research confirms the benefit of full glycogen stores outweighs the cost of carrying the extra mass.\n\n---\n\n## 3. In-Race Fueling\n\n### Fueling Rates by Duration\n\n| Race Duration | Carb Target (g/hr) | Carb Source | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| < 60 min | 0 (or mouth rinse) | N/A | Glycogen stores sufficient; carb mouth rinse may offer CNS benefit |\n| 60-90 min | 30-60 | Glucose or any single carb | Single transporter sufficient |\n| 90 min - 2.5 hr | 60-90 | Glucose + fructose mix | Dual-transport required above 60 g/hr |\n| 2.5 - 4+ hr (marathon) | 60-90 (up to 120 for elites) | Glucose + fructose (1:0.8 to 2:1 ratio) | Gut training essential |\n| Ultra (4+ hr) | 60-90 (realistic target: 50-70) | Glucose + fructose + real food | Include solids; variety important for palatability |\n\n### Why Glucose + Fructose (Multiple Transportable Carbohydrates)\n\n- Glucose absorption via SGLT1 transporter saturates at ~60 g/hr\n- Fructose uses a separate transporter (GLUT5)\n- Combining both allows total absorption of 80-120 g/hr\n- Optimal ratio: 1:0.8 glucose:fructose for maximum oxidation rates, or 2:1 for faster runners (sub-2:35 marathon)\n- Products like Maurten use 0.8:1 or 1:1 ratios, which suit 3+ hour marathoners\n\n### Gut Training\n\n**Purpose**: Increase gastric emptying rate, improve GI comfort, upregulate intestinal carbohydrate transporters (SGLT-1), and enable higher in-race fueling rates.\n\n**Protocol**:\n- Begin 8-10 weeks before race day\n- Start at 30-40 g/hr during training runs\n- Progressively increase to target race-day intake\n- Practice with race-day products at race pace\n- Consume high levels of carbohydrate in daily diet to upregulate transporters\n- Exercise shortly after meals to train GI tolerance\n\n**Results**: Gut training can increase carbohydrate absorption from 60 g/hr to up to 90-120 g/hr while reducing GI distress.\n\n### When to Start Fueling\n\n- Start within the first 20-45 minutes of a marathon/long race\n- Do not wait until feeling fatigued -- glycogen depletion is difficult to reverse mid-race\n- Take a gel 15 minutes before the race start to raise blood glucose and initiate gut blood flow\n- Consume every 15-30 minutes in small, frequent doses rather than large boluses\n\n### Gel vs. Liquid vs. Solid\n\n| Format | Advantages | Disadvantages | Best For |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Gels | Concentrated, easy to carry, quick absorption | Require water, can cause GI distress (10-20% of runners) | Marathons, half marathons |\n| Liquids (sports drinks) | Provide carbs + fluid + electrolytes in one | Hard to achieve high carb rates, volume may cause sloshing | All distances; good as supplement |\n| Solids (bars, chews, real food) | Variety, palatability over long events | Slower digestion, harder to tolerate at higher intensities | Ultras, lower-intensity efforts |\n\n**Key finding**: No carbohydrate source (gel, solid, or liquid) has a distinct physiological performance advantage. However, gels and liquids are better tolerated during running than solids due to the high-impact nature of the activity. Decouple fuel from hydration where possible so each can be managed independently.\n\n### Sodium/Electrolyte Needs During Racing\n\n- **ACSM guideline**: 300-600 mg sodium per hour for exercise > 2 hours\n- **Heavy/salty sweaters**: May need 700+ mg sodium per liter of fluid, potentially up to 1,000-2,300 mg/hr\n- **Average sweat sodium loss**: ~1.0 g/hr (range: 0.07-7.8 g/hr -- enormous individual variability)\n- **Sweat sodium concentration varies**: 7-95 mmol/L across individuals (mean ~43 mmol/L in marathoners)\n- Include sodium in sports drinks at 500-700 mg/L to replace losses, retain consumed fluid, and stimulate thirst\n- In hot/humid conditions (> 25C/77F, > 60% humidity): aim for 300-600 mg/hr sodium\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hydration\n\n### Sweat Rate Calculation\n\n**Formula**: (Pre-exercise weight - Post-exercise weight + fluid consumed - urine produced) / exercise duration in hours = sweat rate (L/hr)\n\n**Simplified version**: (Pre-exercise weight in kg - Post-exercise weight in kg) / hours of exercise = approximate sweat rate in L/hr (assuming no bathroom use and accounting for fluid consumed)\n\n**Typical range**: 0.3-2.5 L/hr (average ~1.1 L/hr for marathoners)\n\n**Note**: Stomach absorption maxes out at ~1.2 L/hr, so runners with sweat rates above this cannot fully replace losses during exercise.\n\n### Drink to Thirst vs. Scheduled Drinking\n\n| Approach | Best For | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|\n| Drink to thirst | Short duration (< 60-90 min), cool conditions, lower intensity | Prevents overhydration; no study shows drinking beyond thirst produces biological advantage |\n| Planned/scheduled drinking | Long duration (> 90 min), hot conditions, high intensity, performance-critical events | Thirst underestimates fluid needs in heat; dehydration > 2% body mass impairs performance in 88% of studies |\n| Individualized (hybrid) | All serious racing | Determine personal sweat rate, use thirst + planned intake, monitor body weight changes |\n\n**Current consensus**: A flexible, individualized strategy that uses thirst as one input among several. For events > 90 minutes, especially in heat, planned drinking with electrolytes is superior to thirst alone. For shorter/cooler events, drinking to thirst is generally sufficient.\n\n### Hyponatremia Risks\n\n- **Definition**: Plasma sodium < 135 mmol/L\n- **Cause**: Overconsumption of hypotonic fluids (water, diluted sports drinks) relative to sodium losses during prolonged exercise (typically > 4-6 hours)\n- **Symptoms**: Headache, nausea, confusion, loss of balance, seizures, coma (fatal in extreme cases)\n- **At-risk populations**: Slower runners (more time on course), smaller athletes, heavy water drinkers, those using NSAIDs\n- **Prevention**: Avoid overhydrating, include adequate sodium, use sweat rate to guide intake, don't drink more than you sweat\n\n### Electrolyte Replacement\n\n| Electrolyte | Function | Replacement Guideline |\n|---|---|---|\n| Sodium (Na+) | Primary electrolyte lost in sweat; fluid retention, nerve function | 300-600 mg/hr during exercise > 2 hr; 500-700 mg/L in drinks |\n| Potassium (K+) | Muscle contraction, fluid balance | Typically adequate from diet; sports drinks contain small amounts |\n| Magnesium (Mg) | Muscle relaxation, energy metabolism | Supplementation not generally needed acutely; ensure adequate dietary intake (310-420 mg/day) |\n\n### Pre-Race Hydration Strategy\n\n- Begin hydrating at least 4 hours before the race: 5-7 mL/kg body weight\n- If urine is still dark 2 hours before: drink another 3-5 mL/kg\n- Include sodium in pre-race fluids to promote fluid retention\n- Acute sodium loading is most effective 12-15 hours before race start\n- Target: light yellow urine (not clear, not dark)\n- Do not chug fluids on race morning -- sip consistently\n\n### Post-Exercise Rehydration\n\n- Replace 150% of body mass lost during exercise (for every 1 kg lost, drink 1.5 L)\n- Include sodium to promote fluid retention\n- Complete rehydration within 2 hours post-exercise for optimal recovery\n\n---\n\n## 5. Caffeine\n\n### Effective Dosing\n\n- **Optimal range**: 3-6 mg/kg body mass\n- **Low-dose (3 mg/kg)**: Most effective for reducing time-trial completion time (2.2% improvement vs. 1.8% for moderate dose), with fewer side effects\n- **Overall performance benefit**: 2-4% improvement in endurance performance (moderate-to-large effect)\n- **Upper limit**: Doses above 6 mg/kg generally provide no additional benefit and increase side effects\n- **Example**: A 70 kg runner would take 210-420 mg (equivalent to 2-4 cups of coffee)\n\n### Timing\n\n- **Standard recommendation**: 30-60 minutes before exercise (allows peak plasma concentration)\n- **Alternative strategy (Louise Burke)**: Use caffeine at the onset of fatigue during the race, with smaller doses (~100-200 mg)\n- **Gum/lozenge formulations**: Faster absorption through buccal mucosa; useful for mid-race caffeine boost\n- **Caffeine in gels**: Many gels contain 25-50 mg caffeine per serving; can be consumed throughout the race for a staggered approach\n\n### Habitual Use and Tolerance\n\n- **Does habitual use reduce benefit?** The evidence is mixed but generally reassuring:\n  - Multiple studies show 3-6 mg/kg caffeine improves performance regardless of habitual use or withdrawal period\n  - A systematic review confirmed habitual caffeine consumption did not influence the acute ergogenic effect\n  - However, crossover habituation studies (28 days of daily intake) show the ergogenic effect is strongest on day 1 and diminishes over time\n- **Current practical advice (Dr. Louise Burke)**: Limiting caffeine before an event to \"get more from your caffeine\" is not particularly well-supported; performance benefits persist in habitual consumers\n- **Individual variation**: Genetic polymorphisms in CYP1A2 (caffeine metabolism) and ADORA2A (adenosine receptors) affect response magnitude\n\n### Side Effects and Considerations\n\n- GI distress (particularly at higher doses)\n- Anxiety, jitteriness, elevated heart rate\n- Insomnia (avoid caffeine after 2 PM for evening sleep quality)\n- Diuretic effect is mild during exercise and does not meaningfully increase dehydration risk\n- Low-dose protocols (3 mg/kg) are associated with significantly fewer adverse effects\n\n---\n\n## 6. Supplements\n\n### IOC/ISSN Classification of Evidence\n\n**Group A (Strong evidence, supported by IOC, ISSN, AIS)**:\n- Caffeine (see Section 5)\n- Creatine monohydrate\n- Dietary nitrate (beetroot juice)\n- Sodium bicarbonate\n- Beta-alanine\n\n**Group B (Emerging/mixed evidence)**:\n- Tart cherry juice\n- Vitamin D (for deficient athletes)\n- Iron (for deficient athletes)\n\n**Group C (Little to no evidence for performance)**:\n- BCAAs (when total protein is adequate)\n- Glutamine\n- Most antioxidant megadoses\n\n### Detailed Supplement Profiles\n\n#### Iron\n- **Prevalence of deficiency**: Up to 60% of female athletes; common in all endurance runners due to foot-strike hemolysis, GI blood loss, and sweat losses\n- **Performance impact**: Iron deficiency impairs endurance performance by 3-4%\n- **Supplementation benefit**: Performance improves 2-20% in iron-deficient athletes with 100 mg/day elemental iron for up to 56 days\n- **Non-anemic iron deficiency**: Athletes with low serum ferritin (< 30 ng/mL) may see 6-15% improvement in VO2max following supplementation (16-100 mg/day for 36-126 days)\n- **Recommendation**: Screen ferritin levels regularly (every 3-6 months for at-risk athletes). Supplement only when deficient. Take with vitamin C to enhance absorption; avoid taking with calcium, tea, or coffee\n- **Dosing**: Typically 65-100 mg elemental iron/day for oral supplementation; alternate-day dosing may improve absorption\n\n#### Vitamin D\n- **Target serum level**: > 40 ng/mL (25(OH)D); deficiency < 20 ng/mL; insufficiency 20-32 ng/mL\n- **Performance impact**: Low levels associated with increased stress fractures, reduced muscle strength, impaired endurance capacity\n- **Supplementation evidence**: Benefits primarily seen in correcting deficiency, not in boosting already-sufficient athletes. 2 of 3 studies showed improved VO2max in supplemented vs. non-supplemented athletes; 5 studies showed increased anaerobic power and strength\n- **2024 meta-analysis finding**: No significant overall strength improvement from vitamin D3 supplementation in athletes with adequate levels (effect size 0.18, p = 0.08)\n- **Dosing**: 1,000-2,000 IU/day for maintenance; 4,000-5,000 IU/day for correction of deficiency (under medical supervision). IOC recommends 1,500-2,000 IU/day for at-risk athletes\n- **Recommendation**: Test 25(OH)D levels. Supplement if < 40 ng/mL. Most beneficial in winter months and for athletes in northern latitudes\n\n#### Beetroot Juice (Dietary Nitrate)\n- **Mechanism**: Nitrate (NO3-) is converted to nitrite (NO2-) and then nitric oxide (NO), which improves vasodilation, mitochondrial efficiency, and muscle contractile function\n- **Performance benefit**: 4-25% improvement in time to exhaustion; 1-3% in time trials under 40 minutes; 3-5% in high-intensity intermittent exercise\n- **Dosing**: 5-9 mmol nitrate (310-560 mg), typically from 70-140 mL concentrated beetroot juice\n- **Timing**: 2-3 hours before exercise for acute benefit. Chronic loading (6+ days) may enhance the effect\n- **Caveat for elites**: Effects appear smaller in highly trained athletes; may require higher doses or longer loading periods\n- **Side effects**: Red/purple urine and stool (harmless); mild GI discomfort at higher doses\n\n#### Tart Cherry Juice\n- **Mechanism**: Rich in anthocyanins (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory compounds)\n- **Benefits**: Reduces muscle soreness, accelerates strength recovery, decreases blood markers of inflammation and oxidative stress after both endurance and strength exercise\n- **Dosing**: 8-12 oz juice or 1 oz concentrate, twice daily for 4-5 days before and 2-3 days after a race or hard training block\n- **Important caveat**: Chronic high-dose antioxidant supplementation may blunt training adaptations. Use strategically around races and hard blocks, not during base/build training when adaptation is the goal\n- **Recommendation**: Reserve for race week / competition recovery, not daily training\n\n#### Creatine Monohydrate\n- **Mechanism**: Increases muscle phosphocreatine stores, enhancing phosphocreatine resynthesis rate during high-intensity efforts\n- **Evidence**: Strong evidence for repeated high-intensity efforts and sprint performance\n- **Dosing**: Loading phase: 20 g/day (4 x 5 g) for 5-7 days. Maintenance: 3-5 g/day\n- **Relevance for runners**: Limited for pure endurance performance; may benefit runners who incorporate sprint/hill work, strength training, or compete in middle-distance events (800m-1500m). Potential 1-2 kg weight gain (water retention) may be detrimental for distance events\n- **Best use case**: Runners doing concurrent strength training, masters athletes (supports muscle mass retention), recovery between repeated high-intensity sessions\n\n#### Beta-Alanine\n- **Mechanism**: Increases muscle carnosine, which buffers intramuscular pH decline during high-intensity exercise\n- **Performance benefit**: Most effective for efforts lasting 30 seconds to ~10 minutes (where acidosis limits performance)\n- **Dosing**: 3.2-6.4 g/day for at least 4-8 weeks (loading required; not acute). Often taken as 0.8-1.6 g per dose, 3-4 times daily\n- **Relevance for runners**: Primarily benefits 800m-5K racers where acidosis is a limiter; minimal benefit for marathon/ultra distances\n- **Side effect**: Paresthesia (tingling skin sensation), harmless but uncomfortable. Sustained-release formulations reduce this\n\n#### Sodium Bicarbonate\n- **Mechanism**: Extracellular buffer; increases blood buffering capacity against hydrogen ion accumulation\n- **Performance benefit**: Most effective for high-intensity efforts lasting 1-7 minutes\n- **Dosing**: 0.2-0.3 g/kg body mass, taken 60-120 minutes before exercise\n- **Relevance for runners**: 800m-3K races; potentially useful for hard interval sessions\n- **Side effect**: GI distress is common (nausea, diarrhea). Enteric-coated capsules or serial dosing (split over 30-60 min with food) may reduce GI issues\n\n---\n\n## 7. Race Week Nutrition\n\n### 7 Days Out: Begin Transition\n- Maintain normal training diet with taper-appropriate caloric intake\n- Begin reducing fiber slightly in final 3-4 days\n- Avoid introducing any new foods, supplements, or restaurants\n- Increase sodium intake slightly to support glycogen storage\n\n### 3-2 Days Out: Carb Loading Phase\n- Increase carbohydrate intake to 8-10 g/kg/day (up to 12 g/kg for some athletes)\n- Reduce fiber intake: swap whole grains for white rice/bread/pasta, reduce vegetable volume\n- Reduce fat and protein proportionally (they are less important this week, and reducing them makes room for more carbs)\n- Spread carbohydrate intake across 3 meals + 2-3 snacks\n- Stay well-hydrated but don't overdo it; monitor urine color (light yellow)\n\n### Fiber Reduction Swaps\n| High-Fiber Food | Low-Fiber Swap |\n|---|---|\n| Oatmeal / bran cereal | Rice Krispies, corn flakes |\n| Brown rice | White rice |\n| Whole wheat bread | White bread, bagels |\n| Raw vegetables | Cooked, peeled vegetables (small portions) |\n| Beans / lentils | White potato, pasta |\n| High-fiber energy bars | Rice cakes, pretzels |\n\n### Night Before the Race\n- Eat the main pre-race meal at lunch, not dinner\n- Dinner: lighter, carb-rich, low-fiber, low-fat, bland\n- Finish dinner by 5-6 PM if possible\n- Optional: carbohydrate-rich snack before bed (pretzels, toast with honey)\n- Do NOT eat a huge pasta dinner -- the traditional \"pasta party\" approach often causes bloating and disrupted sleep\n\n### Race Morning Protocol\n\n**Timing**: Eat breakfast 2.5-4 hours before race start\n\n**Composition**: 1-4 g/kg carbohydrate (individualize based on tolerance)\n- Low-fiber, low-fat, moderate protein\n- Examples: white toast with jam and banana, plain bagel with honey, oatmeal with banana (if tolerated), rice with small amount of egg\n\n**Pre-race snack (15-30 min before start)**:\n- Banana, small serving of pretzels, or an energy gel\n- Tops off blood glucose after the overnight fast\n- Optional: caffeine gel or coffee (3-6 mg/kg, if not taken earlier)\n\n**If experiencing pre-race jitters / nausea**:\n- Take small bites, don't force food\n- Opt for liquid calories (smoothie, sports drink) -- clears the gut faster than solids\n- Even a partial pre-race meal is better than nothing\n\n**Fluids on race morning**:\n- Sip consistently; do not chug\n- 5-7 mL/kg body weight starting 4 hours before the race\n- Include some sodium in fluids\n- Stop heavy drinking 1-2 hours before start to allow bathroom trips\n\n### Common Race Week Mistakes to Avoid\n1. Trying new foods or supplements during race week\n2. Overeating the night before (more is not better; glycogen stores have a ceiling)\n3. Excessive fiber causing GI distress on race day\n4. Overhydrating (clear urine = too much; risk of hyponatremia)\n5. Under-fueling during carb loading (studies show most runners consume only ~1 g/kg vs. recommended 1-4 g/kg for pre-race breakfast)\n6. Skipping breakfast entirely on race morning (research shows eating before a race improves performance)\n\n---\n\n## Authoritative Sources\n\n### Position Stands and Consensus Statements\n- [ISSN Position Stand: Protein and Exercise (Jager et al., 2017)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5477153/)\n- [ISSN Position Stand: Nutrient Timing (Kerksick et al., 2017)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5596471/)\n- [ISSN Position Stand: Caffeine and Exercise Performance (2021)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7777221/)\n- [ISSN Exercise & Sports Nutrition Review Update (2018)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12970-018-0242-y)\n- [IOC Consensus Statement: Dietary Supplements and the High-Performance Athlete](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5867441/)\n- [ACSM Position Stand: Exercise and Fluid Replacement](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17277604/)\n- [IOC Nutrition for Athletes](https://stillmed.olympic.org/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/IOC/Who-We-Are/Commissions/Medical-and-Scientific-Commission/EN-Nutrition-for-Athletes.pdf)\n\n### Research Reviews and Meta-Analyses\n- [Athletes' Nutritional Demands: A Narrative Review (Frontiers in Nutrition, 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10848936/)\n- [Carbohydrate Periodization Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (JISSN, 2021)](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-021-00435-3)\n- [Fuel for the Work Required: Glycogen Threshold Hypothesis (Sports Medicine, 2018)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-018-0867-7)\n- [Carbohydrate Supplementation for Elite Long-Distance Endurance (PMC, 2025)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11901785/)\n- [Multi-Carb Fueling for Runners (Running Writings, 2024)](https://runningwritings.com/2024/08/multi-carb-fueling.html)\n- [Effects of Sodium Intake on Health and Performance in Endurance Sports (PMC, 2022)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8955583/)\n- [Interindividual Variability in Sweat Electrolyte Concentration in Marathoners (JISSN, 2016)](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-016-0141-z)\n- [Drinking Strategies: Planned Drinking Versus Drinking to Thirst (PMC, 2018)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5790864/)\n- [Caffeine Dose and Administration Method Network Meta-Analysis (Nutrients, 2025)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/23/3792)\n- [Efficacy of Dietary Supplements in Elite Athletes: Systematic Review (Frontiers in Nutrition, 2025)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1675654/full)\n- [Iron Deficiency, Supplementation, and Sports Performance in Female Athletes (PMC, 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11863318/)\n- [Effects of Vitamin D Supplementation in Elite Athletes: Systematic Review (2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10768611/)\n- [Nutritional Intake and Timing of Marathon Runners (Sports Medicine - Open, 2024)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40798-024-00801-w)\n- [Nutritional Strategies for Ultra-Marathon Training and Racing (Turkish J Sports Med, 2024)](https://journalofsportsmedicine.org/full-text/729/eng)\n\n---\n\nThis document covers all seven requested nutrition topics with specific numbers, dosages, protocols, and citations from the major sports nutrition authorities (ACSM, ISSN, IOC) and recent peer-reviewed research through 2025.
