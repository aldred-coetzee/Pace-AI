# 30+ Real Questions Runners Ask About GPS Watch Data and Running Metrics

Compiled from Garmin Forums, COROS Help Center, Polar support, LetsRun, 80/20 Endurance Forum, DC Rainmaker, running coaching blogs, and sports science sources.

## 1. "Why does my VO2max estimate keep changing?"

**Data points involved:** HR (heart rate), pace, GPS distance, elevation, temperature (indirectly)

Runners are confused when their watch-estimated VO2max fluctuates run to run. The estimate depends on the relationship between heart rate and pace during outdoor runs where HR exceeds 70% of max for several minutes. Heat, humidity, poor sleep, dehydration, altitude, and even caffeine shift this HR-to-pace relationship, causing the number to move. Common sub-questions: "My VO2max dropped after a hot run -- is my fitness actually worse?" and "Why won't my VO2max update even though I'm running faster in races?" One Garmin forum user reported VO2max stuck at 57 for two months despite improved race times and a jump from 50km to 90km weekly volume. A software bug (fixed in firmware 10.43) was partly responsible, but the underlying confusion persists.

## 2. "My watch says I'm 'Unproductive' -- what do I do?"

**Data points involved:** HR, pace, VO2max trend, training load (EPOC), HRV (overnight)

One of the most frequently asked questions across all Garmin forums. "Unproductive" means your training load is adequate but your VO2max trend is declining. Common triggers: running in heat/humidity (slower pace at same effort), doing lots of easy/recovery runs (which don't push VO2max up), returning from illness, or simply inaccurate wrist HR data inflating perceived effort. Many runners following 80/20 polarized training (80% easy runs) get this label constantly. Coaches universally say: do not let it derail your training plan. The algorithm cannot account for periodization, taper phases, or deliberate base-building blocks.

## 3. "What is training load and is it actually accurate?"

**Data points involved:** HR, HRV, duration, EPOC (excess post-exercise oxygen consumption)

Training load is the cumulative EPOC from all activities over the last 7-10 days. Newer Garmin watches use a weighted 10-day window (today = weight 10, yesterday = 9, etc.). Runners ask whether it properly captures strength training, cross-training, or non-running activities. The consensus: it works well for steady-state endurance but poorly for activities where HR does not correlate well with effort (e.g., weightlifting, yoga, short sprints). Runners also ask about the "optimal range" -- the green zone in Garmin Connect -- and whether exceeding it truly leads to overtraining.

---

## 4. "What is the difference between Training Effect and Training Load?"

**Data points involved:** HR, pace, power, duration, EPOC

Runners frequently confuse these two. Training Effect is a per-activity score (0-5) measuring aerobic and anaerobic impact of a single workout. Training Load is the cumulative strain over 7-10 days. A confusing edge case: Training Effect may show anaerobic benefit while Exercise Load shows zero anaerobic contribution for the same activity. Garmin's exact algorithm is not fully disclosed.

---

## 5. "How accurate is wrist-based heart rate for running?"

**Data points involved:** HR (optical wrist sensor vs. chest strap vs. arm band)

A 2023 study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found wrist-based HR monitors were less accurate at 7.5 mph than 6.0 mph, and less accurate at 6.0 mph than walking. At higher intensities, watches overestimated HR; at lower intensities, they underestimated. Runners with darker skin, tattoos on the wrist, or who wear the watch loosely report worse accuracy. Cadence lock -- where the optical sensor mistakes wrist motion for heartbeats -- is a known issue during tempo runs and intervals. Chest straps remain the gold standard. Arm bands (Polar Verity Sense, COROS HR Band) are emerging as a middle ground.

---

## 6. "Should I train by heart rate or pace?"

**Data points involved:** HR, pace, GPS distance, elevation, temperature (environmental)

This is a perennial debate. The consensus among coaches: use HR for easy/recovery runs (to prevent going too hard), use pace for intervals and tempo runs (because HR lags 30-60 seconds behind intensity changes). Power is emerging as a third option that responds instantly and accounts for hills. Perceived effort (RPE) is always the underlying check. In summer heat, one runner reported HR being 30 bpm higher (135 vs 165) for the same pace -- making pace-only training dangerous and HR-only training frustratingly slow.

---

## 7. "How do I use HRV to guide my training?"

**Data points involved:** HRV (RMSSD), resting HR, sleep quality, stress level

HRV measures beat-to-beat variation and reflects autonomic nervous system balance. Higher HRV = better recovery/parasympathetic dominance. Key confusion: there is no universal "good" HRV number -- it is entirely individual and baseline-dependent. A 2021 study found that runners who adjusted training based on HRV (skipping hard sessions when HRV was low) all set personal records at the subsequent championship, compared to 75% of the control group. Garmin measures HRV overnight; apps like HRV4Training measure it in a morning spot check. Runners ask: "Should I skip my workout if HRV is low?" Answer: look at trends over 7+ days, not single readings.

---

## 8. "What should my running power be?"

**Data points involved:** Running power (watts), pace, elevation/grade, cadence, ground contact time, weight

Running power is algorithm-estimated (not directly measured like cycling power). Stryd, Garmin, COROS, and Polar all produce dramatically different wattage numbers for the same run. A study found Stryd had 4.3% variability, Garmin 7.7%, Polar 14.5%, and RunScribe 14.8%. You cannot compare power between devices. Runners ask: "Is 250W good?" -- there is no universal answer; power zones must be calibrated per-device from a race or time trial. Power's main advantage: it responds instantly to hills and wind, unlike HR which lags, and unlike pace which ignores effort changes on grades.

---

## 9. "Ground contact time -- does it matter?"

**Data points involved:** Ground contact time (ms), cadence, pace, vertical oscillation

GCT measures milliseconds your foot is on the ground per stride. Below 300ms is baseline; elite runners hit 175-200ms. Scientific studies show mixed results on whether shorter GCT improves economy. The practical consensus: GCT is best used as a fatigue detector -- it drifts upward during long runs as muscles tire. It also correlates inversely with pace (faster = shorter GCT), so comparing across different paces is meaningless. GCT balance (left vs. right) can flag asymmetries that may predict injury.

---

## 10. "How to use the race predictor on my watch?"

**Data points involved:** VO2max estimate, HR, pace, training load, training history (6-week window for COROS)

Race predictors use VO2max and training data to estimate finish times at 5K, 10K, half marathon, and marathon. Common complaint: predictions are too aggressive, especially at longer distances. One Garmin forum user found predictions were 10 minutes off at the half marathon. COROS tends to give more generous predictions than Garmin. Tips for better predictions: wear the watch all day (not just for runs), use a chest strap, do varied workouts (long runs improve marathon prediction; threshold runs improve 10K prediction), and look at predicted times for a VO2max 2 points lower than your reported score for more realistic estimates.

---

## 11. "Why does my watch say I need 72 hours of recovery after an easy run?"

**Data points involved:** HR, HRV, training load, sleep score, stress level, EPOC

Recovery time estimates how long until full recovery for another hard workout. It does not mean complete rest. Common causes of inflated recovery times: new watch still learning (first 2 weeks), returning after a break, poor sleep scores, high stress, or a firmware issue. The watch recalculates when you do an easy activity during recovery -- if your HRV looks good, it shortens the timer. Community consensus: recovery time is directionally useful but should not prevent you from doing planned easy runs.

---

## 12. "Is the 180 cadence rule real?"

**Data points involved:** Cadence (steps per minute), pace, stride length

The 180 SPM "rule" comes from Jack Daniels' observations of elite runners at the 1984 Olympics. Research shows optimal cadence for most recreational runners is 165-175 SPM, and forcing 180 SPM when your natural cadence is lower increases oxygen consumption and worsens economy. Cadence increases naturally with speed. The one valid use: increasing cadence by 5-10% can reduce overstriding, which lowers impact forces on knees and may reduce injury risk. Watch cadence data is useful for tracking trends, not hitting a magic number.

## 13. "What is Training Readiness and should I follow it?"

**Data points involved:** HRV, sleep score, recovery time, acute training load, stress history

Garmin's Training Readiness is a composite score (1-100) aggregating sleep, HRV, recovery time, load, and stress. A GB cross-triathlete training 15 hours/week with a coach reported it was "pretty useless -- always showing low." Users who are poor sleepers find it perpetually tanks their score. Experts say it is useful as one data point among many but should never override how you actually feel. The score needs at least 3 weeks to establish an HRV baseline before it becomes meaningful.

---

## 14. "How does Body Battery relate to my running?"

**Data points involved:** HRV, stress level, sleep quality, activity data

Body Battery (5-100 scale) tracks energy reserves throughout the day using HRV, stress, and activity. Unlike HRV Status (overnight only), Body Battery updates continuously. Runners use it to decide whether to push a hard workout or dial back. Common pattern: Body Battery stays low in runners doing high-volume training without sufficient aerobic base. Alcohol dramatically drains it. Limitation: it cannot measure nutrition, hydration, or musculoskeletal fatigue -- factors critical to running readiness.

---

## 15. "How accurate is my watch's lactate threshold estimate?"

**Data points involved:** HR, pace, HRV

A peer-reviewed study found watch-estimated LT heart rate had 5.95-7.15% error (MAE 8.93-11.44 bpm) across Garmin, COROS, and Huawei -- reasonable. But LT pace estimates had 12.70-25.63% error -- much worse. Watches tend to overestimate LT pace. One runner's Garmin estimated LT at 4:14/km but they could hold 4:05/km for 60 minutes. Accuracy improves with a chest strap and guided tests rather than automatic detection. A 30-minute all-out time trial remains the most accurate field test for establishing LT.

## 16. "What is grade-adjusted pace (GAP) / effort pace, and should I trust it?"

**Data points involved:** Pace, GPS elevation/grade, HR (for COROS personalization)

GAP converts hilly running to equivalent flat-terrain pace. Strava calculates it post-run; COROS displays personalized "Effort Pace" in real time. COROS's version learns individual uphill/downhill efficiency over weeks. Limitation: current implementations only adjust for grade, not weather, altitude, or wind. One runner noted "Garmin's GAP did not represent values that match my effort compared to power and heart rate." Stryd's power metric achieves a similar goal by measuring effort directly.

---

## 17. "How much should I slow down in the heat?"

**Data points involved:** Temperature, dew point/humidity, HR, pace

A widely used formula: add temperature (F) + dew point (F). At a combined 150 (e.g., 80F + 70F dew point), expect 4.5-6% slower pace. Slower runners are more affected: ~4-4.5 seconds/mile per 1C increase vs ~1 second/mile for sub-5:45 pace runners. Many coaches recommend ignoring pace entirely in heat and running by HR or perceived effort. Heat acclimation (10-14 days of exposure) improves plasma volume, cardiac output, and VO2max, benefiting performance even in cool conditions later.

---

## 18. "How much does altitude affect my running pace?"

**Data points involved:** Elevation/altitude, HR, pace, SpO2 (on some watches)

Performance declines ~2% per 1,000 feet above 3,000 feet. At 7,000+ feet, easy runs can be 30 seconds/mile slower. Watches with barometric altimeters track elevation gain accurately, but most do not auto-adjust pace targets for altitude. Runners training at altitude should run by HR or effort, not pace. Acclimatization takes 2-3 days for moderate altitudes (1,500-2,500m) and 1-2 weeks for high altitudes (2,500m+).

---

## 19. "What is vertical oscillation and should I try to reduce it?"

**Data points involved:** Vertical oscillation (cm), cadence, ground contact time, pace

Vertical oscillation measures torso bounce (typically 5-10cm). Elite runners oscillate less, but trying to eliminate it entirely (running with very bent knees) wastes more energy. A former Olympian rated it "not useful" as an actionable metric. It is most useful as a fatigue indicator: if vertical oscillation increases while pace holds steady, you are spending more energy to maintain the same speed. Vertical ratio (oscillation / stride length) is considered a better efficiency metric than raw oscillation.

---

## 20. "What is COROS Running Fitness vs Garmin VO2max?"

**Data points involved:** HR, pace, training history (6-week rolling window for COROS, ongoing for Garmin)

COROS Running Fitness represents estimated marathon performance and is deliberately more stable than Garmin's VO2max (which can swing after a single run). COROS requires flat, paved outdoor runs of 25+ minutes at 65%+ HR reserve; trail runs do not count. COROS also provides a Running Performance score (80-120%) comparing each run against your fitness -- over 105% suggests you are peaking. Garmin's VO2max updates after any outdoor run meeting intensity thresholds.

---

## 21. "What is Polar Running Index and how does it compare?"

**Data points involved:** HR, pace, resting HR, max HR, elevation (altitude correction)

Polar's Running Index estimates VO2max from the HR-pace relationship during any run over 12 minutes at 6+ km/h. It is calculated every run and displayed as a single number. Polar emphasizes the 4-week weighted moving average trend (with emphasis on the last 2 weeks) rather than individual readings. Daily variation comes from heat, altitude, dehydration, terrain, shoes, and mood. Unlike Garmin, Polar accounts for uphills and downhills in the calculation when altitude data is available.

---

## 22. "Why is my Performance Condition always negative?"

**Data points involved:** HR, pace, VO2max baseline

Garmin's Performance Condition compares real-time pace-to-HR ratio against your baseline VO2max estimate. Some users report starting every run at -5 and dropping to -10 regardless of effort or feel. Common causes: wrist HR inaccuracy in the first few minutes, starting runs without a warm-up, or an inflated VO2max baseline. If your VO2max estimate is too high (e.g., from one exceptional run), every subsequent run looks "below performance."

---

## 23. "How does sleep data affect my running metrics?"

**Data points involved:** HRV (overnight), sleep stages (light/deep/REM), sleep score, stress level, respiration rate

Garmin uses overnight HRV and sleep quality to compute Training Readiness, HRV Status, and Body Battery recharge. Poor sleep tanks Training Readiness regardless of physical recovery. A study found Garmin's sleep stage accuracy is only 40-50% agreement with polysomnography -- less accurate than Oura, Fitbit, or Apple Watch. Runners with irregular sleep patterns or who remove the watch at night get skewed metrics across the board, since HRV Status requires consistent overnight wear.

---

## 24. "What are heart rate zones and are my watch's auto-calculated zones correct?"

**Data points involved:** HR, max HR, resting HR, lactate threshold HR

Most watches auto-calculate 5 zones using either %maxHR or Heart Rate Reserve (HRR) method. The problem: auto-detected max HR is often wrong (based on the highest HR the watch has ever recorded, which may not be true max). Incorrect max HR cascades into wrong zones, wrong Training Effect scores, and wrong VO2max estimates. Many coaches recommend a field test (e.g., 3x3 minutes uphill all-out) to establish true max HR, then manually setting zones. Apple Watch updates zones monthly from estimated resting and max HR.

---

## 25. "Is respiration rate a useful running metric?"

**Data points involved:** Respiration rate (breaths/min), HRV, accelerometer data

Respiration rate is remarkably stable night-to-night, making it a high signal-to-noise ratio metric. When it changes, it tends to be meaningful -- illness, alcohol, poor recovery. During running, some athletes use breathing patterns to calibrate effort zones. However, most runners find it is not actionable day-to-day for training decisions. Its primary value is early detection of illness (COVID detection 1-2 days before symptoms was demonstrated with respiration rate + SpO2 monitoring).

---

## 26. "How does Apple Watch Training Load compare to Garmin's?"

**Data points involved:** HR, duration, intensity, effort rating

Apple introduced Training Load in watchOS 11 (2024), showing 7-day cumulative effort. It is simpler than Garmin's system -- no Load Focus breakdown (anaerobic/high aerobic/low aerobic), no Training Status classification. Apple also added running power, cadence, stride length, ground contact time, and vertical oscillation in watchOS 9-11. For runners wanting deep analytics, Garmin and COROS still provide more granular training load management.

---

## 27. "Can I compare running power across different devices?"

**Data points involved:** Running power (watts), pace, elevation, accelerometer data, weight

No. Stryd, Garmin, COROS, Polar, and Apple all use different algorithms and produce different watt values for the same run. Switching devices creates a discontinuity in your training history that complicates long-term analysis. Within a single ecosystem, power is highly useful for pacing hills, detecting fatigue, and replacing HR for interval training. But cross-platform comparisons are meaningless.

---

## 28. "What is Garmin's Load Focus and why does it matter?"

**Data points involved:** HR, training load, intensity distribution (low aerobic, high aerobic, anaerobic)

Load Focus breaks your 4-week training into three buckets: low aerobic (easy runs), high aerobic (tempo/threshold), and anaerobic (intervals/sprints). A balanced program should have the majority in low aerobic. Runners training for a marathon who only do easy miles see their high aerobic and anaerobic load drop -- the watch flags this as imbalanced. Conversely, runners doing only hard workouts see too little low aerobic base. This is one of the more actionable Garmin metrics because it directly maps to training plan structure.

---

## 29. "Does stride length from my watch help me run faster?"

**Data points involved:** Stride length, cadence, pace, ground contact time

Watch-measured stride length ranges from 90-150cm. Faster runners have longer strides (sub-3:00 marathoners average ~130cm vs <100cm for 4:00+ marathoners). But intentionally lengthening stride causes overstriding, increasing braking forces and injury risk. The correct approach: stride length increases naturally as running economy and strength improve. Use watch data to monitor trends, not to set targets. If stride length is decreasing at the same pace over a training block, it may indicate fatigue or loss of power.

---

## 30. "How do I know if my watch's Garmin Realtime Stamina feature is useful for racing?"

**Data points involved:** HR, pace, power, VO2max, training history, duration

Realtime Stamina estimates how much energy you have left during a run, expressed as a percentage. It factors in current pace, HR, and your training history. Runners use it for pacing long races -- if stamina is draining too fast early on, you are going too hard. It is a relatively new metric and the community is still evaluating its accuracy. It works best for steady-state efforts and can be misleading during interval workouts where stamina swings rapidly.

## 31. "Why do different platforms (Garmin, Strava, TrainingPeaks) show different VO2max?"

**Data points involved:** HR, pace, elevation, algorithm differences

Garmin uses Firstbeat algorithms; Strava uses its own model; TrainingPeaks calculates from power data. One runner reported Garmin showing 45-46, Intervals.icu showing 50.5, and TrainingPeaks showing 49. The differences come from: different HR data sources (wrist vs chest), different activity filters (Garmin excludes indoor runs), different smoothing windows, and different underlying models. The advice: pick one platform and track trends within it rather than comparing across platforms.

## 32. "Is tracking all these metrics making me a worse runner? (Mental health and over-tracking)"

**Data points involved:** All metrics (HR, HRV, sleep, training load, VO2max, Body Battery)

A growing concern in the running community. One writer described becoming so obsessed with sleep scores that she would wake up at night worrying that checking the time would ruin her HRV. Runners report anxiety when their Training Status says "Unproductive" or when Body Battery is low despite feeling fine. The consensus from coaches: technology should inform, not instruct. If metrics are causing stress or preventing you from running, turn off the notifications or hide the data fields. The best indicator of readiness is how your body feels.

## 33. "What is the COROS Running Fitness Test and should I do it?"

**Data points involved:** HR, pace, structured test protocol (progressive effort)

COROS offers a dedicated Running Fitness Test -- a structured workout that calibrates EvoLab metrics (Running Fitness, pace zones, race predictions) in a single session. It is a hard effort equivalent to a race. Runners ask whether the automatic updates from regular training are sufficient or whether the test provides a meaningful accuracy boost. COROS recommends it when you feel your zones or predictions are out of sync with reality, especially after a break or rapid fitness change.

## 34. "Does my watch accurately track treadmill runs?"

**Data points involved:** Accelerometer-based pace/distance (no GPS), HR, cadence

Without GPS, watches estimate treadmill pace from wrist accelerometer data, which can be 5-15% off. COROS allows manual calibration after each treadmill run to improve future accuracy. Garmin learns from your outdoor stride patterns but can still be inaccurate for different treadmill speeds or inclines. Most importantly: Garmin does not update VO2max from treadmill runs to preserve accuracy. This means treadmill-heavy runners may see stale VO2max estimates and "maintaining" Training Status.
