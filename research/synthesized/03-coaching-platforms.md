## Research Summary: 40 High-Value Running Coaching Questions

I searched across 10+ platforms (TrainingPeaks, McMillan, VDOT/Jack Daniels, Runners Connect, Garmin Coach, Runna, Final Surge, Runcoach, Hal Higdon, Strength Running, and multiple coaching blogs/forums) and fetched detailed content from the most useful pages. The result is a document containing **40 specific questions** organized into 8 categories, with data inputs, calculation models, and pricing analysis for each.

### What People Pay For (The Value Signal)

The pricing tier analysis reveals what's most commercially valuable:

| Tier | Price | What They're Buying |
|---|---|---|
| Human 1:1 coaching | $100-500/mo | Personalized answers to ALL 40 questions, with human judgment |
| Adaptive coaching apps (Runna) | $18/mo | "What should I run today?" + pace targets + plan flexibility |
| Analytics platforms (TrainingPeaks) | $135/yr | CTL/ATL/TSB fitness tracking, injury risk monitoring |
| Calculators (McMillan, VDOT) | Free-$20/mo | Training paces, race predictions |

### The 8 Question Categories

1. **Training Pace & Zones** (Q1-Q5): "What should my easy pace be?", "What are my training paces?", "Pace vs heart rate?", "What HR zones?", "Have my paces improved?" -- Uses VDOT, McMillan, Karvonen HR formulas. Requires recent race result + HR data.

2. **Race Prediction & Goal Setting** (Q6-Q10): "What marathon can I run based on my 5K?", "Can I BQ?", "Realistic goal time?", "Age-graded comparison?", "Speed-type vs endurance-type?" -- Uses Riegel formula, VDOT equivalency, Cameron formula. Requires race results at one or more distances.

3. **Training Load & Injury Prevention** (Q11-Q16): "Am I increasing too fast?", "What's my fitness?", "How fatigued am I?", "Am I ready to race?", "Am I overtraining?", "How fast can I add mileage?" -- Uses ACWR (sweet spot 0.8-1.3), CTL/ATL/TSB (Performance Management Chart). Requires daily training log for 4-8 weeks.

4. **Training Plan Structure** (Q17-Q22): "What should I run today?", "How to structure my week?", "How long should my longest run be?", "When to start training?", "How to taper?", "Post-race recovery?" -- Uses periodization models (Daniels, Pfitzinger, Lydiard). Requires goal race, current fitness, available days.

5. **Specific Workout Design** (Q23-Q26): "What interval workout?", "What tempo pace?", "How to do marathon pace in long runs?", "What strength work?" -- Uses VDOT training intensities, phase-specific prescription. Requires current VDOT + training phase.

6. **Race Day Execution** (Q27-Q30): "Race day pace?", "Heat adjustment?", "Altitude adjustment?", "Negative or even splits?" -- Uses McMillan/VDOT with heat/altitude adjustment formulas. Requires fitness data + course profile + weather.

7. **Running Through Life** (Q31-Q35): "Adjust for sickness/travel/stress?", "Run through pain?", "Return from injury?", "Balance with strength?", "Catch up after missed days?" -- Requires subjective wellness data + human judgment. This is what human coaches charge $100-500/mo for.

8. **Progress & Motivation** (Q36-Q40): "Is my training working?", "Why did my race go wrong?", "Am I running enough mileage?", "What's my VO2max?", "How to plan my year?" -- Uses VDOT trending, CTL trending, pace-at-HR analysis. Requires longitudinal training data.

### Key Data Inputs Needed (Across All 40 Questions)

The document maps every question to its required data sources. The most important inputs are:
- **Recent race result** (answers 25+ questions) -- from Strava or manual entry
- **Daily training log** (answers 15+ questions) -- from Strava/Garmin sync
- **Heart rate data** (answers 6+ questions) -- from watch sync
- **Goal race info** (answers 15+ questions) -- manual entry
- **Subjective wellness** (answers 5+ questions) -- manual entry

### Models & Calculations Required

| Model | Coverage |
|---|---|
| VDOT (Jack Daniels) | Training paces, race predictions, progress tracking |
| Riegel formula | Race equivalency across distances |
| CTL/ATL/TSB | Fitness, fatigue, form (Performance Management Chart) |
| ACWR | Injury risk from training load spikes |
| TSS | Foundation metric for all load calculations |
| HR Zone models (Friel, Karvonen) | Training intensity prescription |
| Heat/altitude adjustments | Race day pace corrections |
| Age grading (WMA tables) | Performance normalization |
