## 1. Daily Nutrition for Runners

### Macronutrient Guidelines by Training Volume

| Training Volume | Carbohydrate (g/kg/day) | Protein (g/kg/day) | Fat (% of calories) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Light activity (30-60 min/day) | 3-5 | 1.2-1.4 | 25-35% |
| Moderate training (1-2 hr/day) | 5-7 | 1.4-1.6 | 20-35% |
| High volume (2-3 hr/day) | 6-10 | 1.6-1.8 | 20-35% |
| Extreme volume (4-5+ hr/day, ultra training) | 8-12 | 1.6-2.0 | 20-35% |

**Key authority references**: The ACSM, IOC, and ISSN converge on 1.4-2.0 g/kg/day protein and 3-12 g/kg/day carbohydrate depending on training load. Fat should constitute at least 20% of total calories to support hormone production and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.

### Carbohydrate Periodization ("Train Low, Compete High")

**Concept**: Deliberately training with reduced carbohydrate availability to enhance endurance-related metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle, while ensuring full carbohydrate availability for key workouts and competitions.

**Strategies**:
- **Fasted training**: Easy runs in the morning after overnight fast (liver glycogen reduced, muscle glycogen largely intact)
- **Sleep low, train low**: Train in the afternoon/evening, withhold carbohydrates overnight, train again the next morning in a glycogen-depleted state
- **Fuel for the work required**: Adjust carbohydrate availability meal-by-meal and day-by-day based on the session's intensity and purpose

**What the evidence shows**:
- 73% of studies show augmented cell signaling with train-low approaches
- 75% show enhanced gene expression related to mitochondrial biogenesis
- 78% show increased oxidative enzyme activity/protein content
- However, only 37% of studies measuring performance outcomes showed improvement; 63% showed no change
- A 2021 JISSN meta-analysis found no overall effect of carbohydrate periodization on endurance performance versus high-carb controls
- A 2024 study (Prieto-Bellver et al.) found no between-group differences in highly trained cyclists

**Practical application**: Apply train-low for 30-50% of sessions (easy/low-intensity only). Always fuel fully for key workouts, races, and high-intensity sessions. The glycogen threshold hypothesis suggests post-training glycogen should be below 300 mmol/kg dry weight but not below 100 mmol/kg (below which muscle protein synthesis may be impaired).

**What elite runners actually do**: East African distance runners habitually eat a high-carbohydrate diet to support their high training loads, while incorporating some incidental train-low sessions (e.g., fasted morning runs).

### Protein Timing and Amounts for Recovery

**Per-dose recommendations (ISSN Position Stand)**:
- 0.25-0.40 g/kg body mass per dose (absolute: 20-40 g per serving)
- Every 3-4 hours throughout the day
- Each dose should contain 700-3,000 mg leucine plus a balanced array of essential amino acids

**Post-run recovery**:
- If rapid glycogen restoration is required (< 4 hours between sessions): combine carbohydrate (0.8 g/kg/h) with protein (0.2-0.4 g/kg/h)
- When carbohydrate intake is suboptimal (< 1.2 g/kg/h), adding protein enhances glycogen recovery
- The "anabolic window" is broader than commonly believed -- the anabolic effect of exercise lasts at least 24 hours but diminishes with increasing time post-exercise

**Pre-sleep protein**: 30-40 g of casein protein before bed increases overnight muscle protein synthesis and metabolic rate without affecting fat breakdown.

### Caloric Needs Estimation

**Step 1 -- Calculate BMR** (Mifflin-St Jeor, recommended for athletes):
- Men: BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age) + 5
- Women: BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age) - 161

**Step 2 -- Apply activity multiplier**:
- Moderately active runner (3-5 days/week): BMR x 1.55
- Very active runner (6-7 days/week): BMR x 1.725
- Peak training / high-mileage: BMR x 1.9-2.3

**Running-specific approximation**: ~1 kcal per kg of body weight per km traveled (e.g., a 70 kg runner burns approximately 70 kcal per km, or roughly 100 kcal per mile).

## 2. Carb Loading

### Protocols by Race Distance

| Race Distance | Carb Loading Needed? | Protocol |
|---|---|---|
| 5K / 10K | No | Normal glycogen stores sufficient for < 90 min of effort |
| Half marathon (< 90 min finish) | Likely not needed | Normal diet with carb-focused pre-race meal |
| Half marathon (> 90 min finish) | Modified approach | 7-8 g/kg/day for 1-2 days before race |
| Marathon | Essential | 8-12 g/kg/day for 2-3 days before race |
| Ultramarathon | Essential | 10-12 g/kg/day for 2-3 days before race |

### Classic vs. Modified Carb Loading

**Classic protocol (Bergstrom, 1960s)** -- now considered outdated:
- 3-4 days of glycogen-depleting exercise + low-carb diet
- Followed by 3-4 days of high-carb diet (8-12 g/kg/day)
- Risks: fatigue, mood disturbance, injury during depletion phase

**Modern/modified protocol** -- current recommendation:
- No depletion phase required
- Taper training volume while increasing carbohydrates to 8-12 g/kg/day for 2-3 days
- Well-trained athletes may achieve full glycogen stores in as little as 24-36 hours
- Performance improvement: 2-3% in controlled studies, up to 20% in exercise capacity tests

### Practical Carb Loading Guidelines

**Target**: 8-10 g/kg/day (up to 12 g/kg/day for some athletes). For a 70 kg runner, that equals 560-840 g of carbs per day.

**Timing**: Start 2-3 days before race. If racing Sunday, begin Thursday or Friday.

**Preferred food sources** (low-fiber, easily digestible):
- White rice, white bread, white pasta
- Pancakes, bagels, rice cakes
- Bananas, fruit bars, fruit leather
- Sports drinks, gels, energy bars
- Maple syrup, honey, jam

**Expected weight gain**: 1-2 kg from glycogen + water storage (each gram of glycogen is stored with 3 g of water). Research confirms the benefit of full glycogen stores outweighs the cost of carrying the extra mass.

## 3. In-Race Fueling

### Fueling Rates by Duration

| Race Duration | Carb Target (g/hr) | Carb Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| < 60 min | 0 (or mouth rinse) | N/A | Glycogen stores sufficient; carb mouth rinse may offer CNS benefit |
| 60-90 min | 30-60 | Glucose or any single carb | Single transporter sufficient |
| 90 min - 2.5 hr | 60-90 | Glucose + fructose mix | Dual-transport required above 60 g/hr |
| 2.5 - 4+ hr (marathon) | 60-90 (up to 120 for elites) | Glucose + fructose (1:0.8 to 2:1 ratio) | Gut training essential |
| Ultra (4+ hr) | 60-90 (realistic target: 50-70) | Glucose + fructose + real food | Include solids; variety important for palatability |

### Why Glucose + Fructose (Multiple Transportable Carbohydrates)

- Glucose absorption via SGLT1 transporter saturates at ~60 g/hr
- Fructose uses a separate transporter (GLUT5)
- Combining both allows total absorption of 80-120 g/hr
- Optimal ratio: 1:0.8 glucose:fructose for maximum oxidation rates, or 2:1 for faster runners (sub-2:35 marathon)
- Products like Maurten use 0.8:1 or 1:1 ratios, which suit 3+ hour marathoners

### Gut Training

**Purpose**: Increase gastric emptying rate, improve GI comfort, upregulate intestinal carbohydrate transporters (SGLT-1), and enable higher in-race fueling rates.

**Protocol**:
- Begin 8-10 weeks before race day
- Start at 30-40 g/hr during training runs
- Progressively increase to target race-day intake
- Practice with race-day products at race pace
- Consume high levels of carbohydrate in daily diet to upregulate transporters
- Exercise shortly after meals to train GI tolerance

**Results**: Gut training can increase carbohydrate absorption from 60 g/hr to up to 90-120 g/hr while reducing GI distress.

### When to Start Fueling

- Start within the first 20-45 minutes of a marathon/long race
- Do not wait until feeling fatigued -- glycogen depletion is difficult to reverse mid-race
- Take a gel 15 minutes before the race start to raise blood glucose and initiate gut blood flow
- Consume every 15-30 minutes in small, frequent doses rather than large boluses

### Gel vs. Liquid vs. Solid

| Format | Advantages | Disadvantages | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gels | Concentrated, easy to carry, quick absorption | Require water, can cause GI distress (10-20% of runners) | Marathons, half marathons |
| Liquids (sports drinks) | Provide carbs + fluid + electrolytes in one | Hard to achieve high carb rates, volume may cause sloshing | All distances; good as supplement |
| Solids (bars, chews, real food) | Variety, palatability over long events | Slower digestion, harder to tolerate at higher intensities | Ultras, lower-intensity efforts |

**Key finding**: No carbohydrate source (gel, solid, or liquid) has a distinct physiological performance advantage. However, gels and liquids are better tolerated during running than solids due to the high-impact nature of the activity. Decouple fuel from hydration where possible so each can be managed independently.

### Sodium/Electrolyte Needs During Racing

- **ACSM guideline**: 300-600 mg sodium per hour for exercise > 2 hours
- **Heavy/salty sweaters**: May need 700+ mg sodium per liter of fluid, potentially up to 1,000-2,300 mg/hr
- **Average sweat sodium loss**: ~1.0 g/hr (range: 0.07-7.8 g/hr -- enormous individual variability)
- **Sweat sodium concentration varies**: 7-95 mmol/L across individuals (mean ~43 mmol/L in marathoners)
- Include sodium in sports drinks at 500-700 mg/L to replace losses, retain consumed fluid, and stimulate thirst
- In hot/humid conditions (> 25C/77F, > 60% humidity): aim for 300-600 mg/hr sodium

---

## 4. Hydration

### Sweat Rate Calculation

**Formula**: (Pre-exercise weight - Post-exercise weight + fluid consumed - urine produced) / exercise duration in hours = sweat rate (L/hr)

**Simplified version**: (Pre-exercise weight in kg - Post-exercise weight in kg) / hours of exercise = approximate sweat rate in L/hr (assuming no bathroom use and accounting for fluid consumed)

**Typical range**: 0.3-2.5 L/hr (average ~1.1 L/hr for marathoners)

**Note**: Stomach absorption maxes out at ~1.2 L/hr, so runners with sweat rates above this cannot fully replace losses during exercise.

### Drink to Thirst vs. Scheduled Drinking

| Approach | Best For | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Drink to thirst | Short duration (< 60-90 min), cool conditions, lower intensity | Prevents overhydration; no study shows drinking beyond thirst produces biological advantage |
| Planned/scheduled drinking | Long duration (> 90 min), hot conditions, high intensity, performance-critical events | Thirst underestimates fluid needs in heat; dehydration > 2% body mass impairs performance in 88% of studies |
| Individualized (hybrid) | All serious racing | Determine personal sweat rate, use thirst + planned intake, monitor body weight changes |

**Current consensus**: A flexible, individualized strategy that uses thirst as one input among several. For events > 90 minutes, especially in heat, planned drinking with electrolytes is superior to thirst alone. For shorter/cooler events, drinking to thirst is generally sufficient.

### Hyponatremia Risks

- **Definition**: Plasma sodium < 135 mmol/L
- **Cause**: Overconsumption of hypotonic fluids (water, diluted sports drinks) relative to sodium losses during prolonged exercise (typically > 4-6 hours)
- **Symptoms**: Headache, nausea, confusion, loss of balance, seizures, coma (fatal in extreme cases)
- **At-risk populations**: Slower runners (more time on course), smaller athletes, heavy water drinkers, those using NSAIDs
- **Prevention**: Avoid overhydrating, include adequate sodium, use sweat rate to guide intake, don't drink more than you sweat

### Electrolyte Replacement

| Electrolyte | Function | Replacement Guideline |
|---|---|---|
| Sodium (Na+) | Primary electrolyte lost in sweat; fluid retention, nerve function | 300-600 mg/hr during exercise > 2 hr; 500-700 mg/L in drinks |
| Potassium (K+) | Muscle contraction, fluid balance | Typically adequate from diet; sports drinks contain small amounts |
| Magnesium (Mg) | Muscle relaxation, energy metabolism | Supplementation not generally needed acutely; ensure adequate dietary intake (310-420 mg/day) |

### Pre-Race Hydration Strategy

- Begin hydrating at least 4 hours before the race: 5-7 mL/kg body weight
- If urine is still dark 2 hours before: drink another 3-5 mL/kg
- Include sodium in pre-race fluids to promote fluid retention
- Acute sodium loading is most effective 12-15 hours before race start
- Target: light yellow urine (not clear, not dark)
- Do not chug fluids on race morning -- sip consistently

### Post-Exercise Rehydration

- Replace 150% of body mass lost during exercise (for every 1 kg lost, drink 1.5 L)
- Include sodium to promote fluid retention
- Complete rehydration within 2 hours post-exercise for optimal recovery

---

## 5. Caffeine

### Effective Dosing

- **Optimal range**: 3-6 mg/kg body mass
- **Low-dose (3 mg/kg)**: Most effective for reducing time-trial completion time (2.2% improvement vs. 1.8% for moderate dose), with fewer side effects
- **Overall performance benefit**: 2-4% improvement in endurance performance (moderate-to-large effect)
- **Upper limit**: Doses above 6 mg/kg generally provide no additional benefit and increase side effects
- **Example**: A 70 kg runner would take 210-420 mg (equivalent to 2-4 cups of coffee)

### Timing

- **Standard recommendation**: 30-60 minutes before exercise (allows peak plasma concentration)
- **Alternative strategy (Louise Burke)**: Use caffeine at the onset of fatigue during the race, with smaller doses (~100-200 mg)
- **Gum/lozenge formulations**: Faster absorption through buccal mucosa; useful for mid-race caffeine boost
- **Caffeine in gels**: Many gels contain 25-50 mg caffeine per serving; can be consumed throughout the race for a staggered approach

### Habitual Use and Tolerance

- **Does habitual use reduce benefit?** The evidence is mixed but generally reassuring:
  - Multiple studies show 3-6 mg/kg caffeine improves performance regardless of habitual use or withdrawal period
  - A systematic review confirmed habitual caffeine consumption did not influence the acute ergogenic effect
  - However, crossover habituation studies (28 days of daily intake) show the ergogenic effect is strongest on day 1 and diminishes over time
- **Current practical advice (Dr. Louise Burke)**: Limiting caffeine before an event to "get more from your caffeine" is not particularly well-supported; performance benefits persist in habitual consumers
- **Individual variation**: Genetic polymorphisms in CYP1A2 (caffeine metabolism) and ADORA2A (adenosine receptors) affect response magnitude

### Side Effects and Considerations

- GI distress (particularly at higher doses)
- Anxiety, jitteriness, elevated heart rate
- Insomnia (avoid caffeine after 2 PM for evening sleep quality)
- Diuretic effect is mild during exercise and does not meaningfully increase dehydration risk
- Low-dose protocols (3 mg/kg) are associated with significantly fewer adverse effects

## 6. Supplements

### IOC/ISSN Classification of Evidence

**Group A (Strong evidence, supported by IOC, ISSN, AIS)**:
- Caffeine (see Section 5)
- Creatine monohydrate
- Dietary nitrate (beetroot juice)
- Sodium bicarbonate
- Beta-alanine

**Group B (Emerging/mixed evidence)**:
- Tart cherry juice
- Vitamin D (for deficient athletes)
- Iron (for deficient athletes)

**Group C (Little to no evidence for performance)**:
- BCAAs (when total protein is adequate)
- Glutamine
- Most antioxidant megadoses

### Detailed Supplement Profiles

#### Iron
- **Prevalence of deficiency**: Up to 60% of female athletes; common in all endurance runners due to foot-strike hemolysis, GI blood loss, and sweat losses
- **Performance impact**: Iron deficiency impairs endurance performance by 3-4%
- **Supplementation benefit**: Performance improves 2-20% in iron-deficient athletes with 100 mg/day elemental iron for up to 56 days
- **Non-anemic iron deficiency**: Athletes with low serum ferritin (< 30 ng/mL) may see 6-15% improvement in VO2max following supplementation (16-100 mg/day for 36-126 days)
- **Recommendation**: Screen ferritin levels regularly (every 3-6 months for at-risk athletes). Supplement only when deficient. Take with vitamin C to enhance absorption; avoid taking with calcium, tea, or coffee
- **Dosing**: Typically 65-100 mg elemental iron/day for oral supplementation; alternate-day dosing may improve absorption

#### Vitamin D
- **Target serum level**: > 40 ng/mL (25(OH)D); deficiency < 20 ng/mL; insufficiency 20-32 ng/mL
- **Performance impact**: Low levels associated with increased stress fractures, reduced muscle strength, impaired endurance capacity
- **Supplementation evidence**: Benefits primarily seen in correcting deficiency, not in boosting already-sufficient athletes. 2 of 3 studies showed improved VO2max in supplemented vs. non-supplemented athletes; 5 studies showed increased anaerobic power and strength
- **2024 meta-analysis finding**: No significant overall strength improvement from vitamin D3 supplementation in athletes with adequate levels (effect size 0.18, p = 0.08)
- **Dosing**: 1,000-2,000 IU/day for maintenance; 4,000-5,000 IU/day for correction of deficiency (under medical supervision). IOC recommends 1,500-2,000 IU/day for at-risk athletes
- **Recommendation**: Test 25(OH)D levels. Supplement if < 40 ng/mL. Most beneficial in winter months and for athletes in northern latitudes

#### Beetroot Juice (Dietary Nitrate)
- **Mechanism**: Nitrate (NO3-) is converted to nitrite (NO2-) and then nitric oxide (NO), which improves vasodilation, mitochondrial efficiency, and muscle contractile function
- **Performance benefit**: 4-25% improvement in time to exhaustion; 1-3% in time trials under 40 minutes; 3-5% in high-intensity intermittent exercise
- **Dosing**: 5-9 mmol nitrate (310-560 mg), typically from 70-140 mL concentrated beetroot juice
- **Timing**: 2-3 hours before exercise for acute benefit. Chronic loading (6+ days) may enhance the effect
- **Caveat for elites**: Effects appear smaller in highly trained athletes; may require higher doses or longer loading periods
- **Side effects**: Red/purple urine and stool (harmless); mild GI discomfort at higher doses

#### Tart Cherry Juice
- **Mechanism**: Rich in anthocyanins (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory compounds)
- **Benefits**: Reduces muscle soreness, accelerates strength recovery, decreases blood markers of inflammation and oxidative stress after both endurance and strength exercise
- **Dosing**: 8-12 oz juice or 1 oz concentrate, twice daily for 4-5 days before and 2-3 days after a race or hard training block
- **Important caveat**: Chronic high-dose antioxidant supplementation may blunt training adaptations. Use strategically around races and hard blocks, not during base/build training when adaptation is the goal
- **Recommendation**: Reserve for race week / competition recovery, not daily training

#### Creatine Monohydrate
- **Mechanism**: Increases muscle phosphocreatine stores, enhancing phosphocreatine resynthesis rate during high-intensity efforts
- **Evidence**: Strong evidence for repeated high-intensity efforts and sprint performance
- **Dosing**: Loading phase: 20 g/day (4 x 5 g) for 5-7 days. Maintenance: 3-5 g/day
- **Relevance for runners**: Limited for pure endurance performance; may benefit runners who incorporate sprint/hill work, strength training, or compete in middle-distance events (800m-1500m). Potential 1-2 kg weight gain (water retention) may be detrimental for distance events
- **Best use case**: Runners doing concurrent strength training, masters athletes (supports muscle mass retention), recovery between repeated high-intensity sessions

#### Beta-Alanine
- **Mechanism**: Increases muscle carnosine, which buffers intramuscular pH decline during high-intensity exercise
- **Performance benefit**: Most effective for efforts lasting 30 seconds to ~10 minutes (where acidosis limits performance)
- **Dosing**: 3.2-6.4 g/day for at least 4-8 weeks (loading required; not acute). Often taken as 0.8-1.6 g per dose, 3-4 times daily
- **Relevance for runners**: Primarily benefits 800m-5K racers where acidosis is a limiter; minimal benefit for marathon/ultra distances
- **Side effect**: Paresthesia (tingling skin sensation), harmless but uncomfortable. Sustained-release formulations reduce this

#### Sodium Bicarbonate
- **Mechanism**: Extracellular buffer; increases blood buffering capacity against hydrogen ion accumulation
- **Performance benefit**: Most effective for high-intensity efforts lasting 1-7 minutes
- **Dosing**: 0.2-0.3 g/kg body mass, taken 60-120 minutes before exercise
- **Relevance for runners**: 800m-3K races; potentially useful for hard interval sessions
- **Side effect**: GI distress is common (nausea, diarrhea). Enteric-coated capsules or serial dosing (split over 30-60 min with food) may reduce GI issues

## 7. Race Week Nutrition

### 7 Days Out: Begin Transition
- Maintain normal training diet with taper-appropriate caloric intake
- Begin reducing fiber slightly in final 3-4 days
- Avoid introducing any new foods, supplements, or restaurants
- Increase sodium intake slightly to support glycogen storage

### 3-2 Days Out: Carb Loading Phase
- Increase carbohydrate intake to 8-10 g/kg/day (up to 12 g/kg for some athletes)
- Reduce fiber intake: swap whole grains for white rice/bread/pasta, reduce vegetable volume
- Reduce fat and protein proportionally (they are less important this week, and reducing them makes room for more carbs)
- Spread carbohydrate intake across 3 meals + 2-3 snacks
- Stay well-hydrated but don't overdo it; monitor urine color (light yellow)

### Fiber Reduction Swaps
| High-Fiber Food | Low-Fiber Swap |
|---|---|
| Oatmeal / bran cereal | Rice Krispies, corn flakes |
| Brown rice | White rice |
| Whole wheat bread | White bread, bagels |
| Raw vegetables | Cooked, peeled vegetables (small portions) |
| Beans / lentils | White potato, pasta |
| High-fiber energy bars | Rice cakes, pretzels |

### Night Before the Race
- Eat the main pre-race meal at lunch, not dinner
- Dinner: lighter, carb-rich, low-fiber, low-fat, bland
- Finish dinner by 5-6 PM if possible
- Optional: carbohydrate-rich snack before bed (pretzels, toast with honey)
- Do NOT eat a huge pasta dinner -- the traditional "pasta party" approach often causes bloating and disrupted sleep

### Race Morning Protocol

**Timing**: Eat breakfast 2.5-4 hours before race start

**Composition**: 1-4 g/kg carbohydrate (individualize based on tolerance)
- Low-fiber, low-fat, moderate protein
- Examples: white toast with jam and banana, plain bagel with honey, oatmeal with banana (if tolerated), rice with small amount of egg

**Pre-race snack (15-30 min before start)**:
- Banana, small serving of pretzels, or an energy gel
- Tops off blood glucose after the overnight fast
- Optional: caffeine gel or coffee (3-6 mg/kg, if not taken earlier)

**If experiencing pre-race jitters / nausea**:
- Take small bites, don't force food
- Opt for liquid calories (smoothie, sports drink) -- clears the gut faster than solids
- Even a partial pre-race meal is better than nothing

**Fluids on race morning**:
- Sip consistently; do not chug
- 5-7 mL/kg body weight starting 4 hours before the race
- Include some sodium in fluids
- Stop heavy drinking 1-2 hours before start to allow bathroom trips

### Common Race Week Mistakes to Avoid
1. Trying new foods or supplements during race week
2. Overeating the night before (more is not better; glycogen stores have a ceiling)
3. Excessive fiber causing GI distress on race day
4. Overhydrating (clear urine = too much; risk of hyponatremia)
5. Under-fueling during carb loading (studies show most runners consume only ~1 g/kg vs. recommended 1-4 g/kg for pre-race breakfast)
6. Skipping breakfast entirely on race morning (research shows eating before a race improves performance)
