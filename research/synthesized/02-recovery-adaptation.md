## 1. HRV (Heart Rate Variability)

### Key Metrics

**rMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences)**
- The primary metric for monitoring training readiness in endurance athletes
- Measures parasympathetic (vagal) nervous system activity
- More reliable than other HRV metrics because it is less affected by respiratory rate, heart rate, or recording duration
- Higher rMSSD relative to individual baseline indicates better recovery and readiness
- Correlates with training adaptations including VO2max, max running velocity, and time-trial performance

**SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals)**
- Reflects overall HRV, capturing both sympathetic and parasympathetic contributions
- Must be standardized to a specific recording length to be comparable
- A sharp post-training decrease may indicate increased load; slow recovery suggests limited autonomic reserve
- Emerging ratio-based metrics (SDNN/rMSSD) show promise for capturing sympathetic activity and autonomic balance

**Reference Values (rMSSD)**
- No universally standardized cutoff values exist; individual baselines are paramount
- General adult range: 19-107 ms
- Healthy adults (age 38-42): approximately 19-48 ms
- Elite/well-trained endurance athletes: commonly 60-100+ ms
- Lifelong endurance athletes maintain rMSSD values 20-30% above age-matched sedentary peers
- HRV declines with age: approximately 80 ms in teenagers to approximately 25 ms in those over 75

### Morning Measurement Protocol

**Recommended Approach:**
- Record HRV as close to awakening as possible, before getting out of bed
- Seated or standing position preferred over supine (lying down causes "parasympathetic saturation" that reduces measurement sensitivity)
- Minimum protocol: 1-minute stabilization period, followed by 1-minute recording
- Standard protocol: 5-10 minutes upon awakening
- Chest-strap ECG is the gold standard; PPG-derived rMSSD averages 6-11% lower
- Discard recordings with more than approximately 5% corrected/artifact beats
- Take at least 4-5 readings per week; daily readings are ideal

**Why Morning Matters:**
- Morning rMSSD recordings are more strongly associated with performance than later-day recordings
- Transient fluctuations in autonomic activity throughout the day can mask the relationship between HRV and physical readiness
- Nocturnal and morning rMSSD show no significant differences when measured across several weeks

### Interpreting HRV for Training Decisions

**The 7-Day Rolling Average + SWC Method:**
- Calculate the natural log of rMSSD (Ln-rMSSD) as a 7-day rolling average
- Compute the Smallest Worthwhile Change (SWC) = mean +/- 0.5 x standard deviation
- If 7-day average is **within or above** SWC: prescribe planned training, including high-intensity sessions
- If 7-day average is **below** the lower SWC limit: substitute a low-intensity session for any planned hard work
- Practical rule of thumb: a 7.5% drop in raw rMSSD (or approximately 1.5-point drop in 20 x Ln-rMSSD) should trigger switching from intense to low-intensity training

**Readiness Indicators:**
- HRV stable around individual baseline within SWC = good readiness
- Gradually increasing rMSSD trend over weeks = positive adaptation
- rMSSD coefficient of variation (CV) remaining low = consistent recovery

**Fatigue / Warning Indicators:**
- Overnight rMSSD more than 10% below 30-day rolling average = consider a lower-intensity day
- Sustained 20% or greater drop in rMSSD = may precede upper-respiratory illness or non-functional overreaching
- Persistently elevated rMSSD CV over several weeks = early warning of maladaptation
- HRV remaining outside normal range (both abnormally high AND abnormally low) despite reduced training = sign of non-functional overreaching

**Acute Response to Training:**
- Immediately post-training: SDNN decreases approximately 35%, rMSSD decreases approximately 40%
- During 2-hour recovery: parameters partially return toward baseline
- Full autonomic recovery may take 24-72 hours depending on session intensity

**HRV-Guided Training Outperforms Predefined Programs:**
- Research on professional runners showed the HRV-guided group achieved significantly greater improvement in maximal velocity (P = 0.027, effect size d = 0.66) compared to a traditionally programmed group
- HRV-guided training personalizes load to maximize physiological adaptations and minimize variability in individual responses

### Important Caveats

- Never rely on HRV in isolation; interpret alongside wellness questionnaires, training load data, resting HR, and subjective feelings
- HRV does not fully reflect psychosocial stressors (poor sleep, emotional distress, work demands, travel fatigue)
- Reduced resting rMSSD may not be a sensitive overtraining marker in highly aerobically trained athletes; it works best in combination with secondary markers
- Individual thresholds matter more than population norms

## 2. Sleep & Recovery

### Why Sleep Is Foundational for Runners

Sleep is not an optional recovery tool but a foundational pillar of endurance athlete health, performance, and injury prevention. During deep sleep (slow-wave sleep):
- Muscle repair and protein synthesis intensify
- Growth hormone secretion peaks (up to 75% of daily GH released during sleep)
- Muscle glycogen stores are replenished
- Neural pathway consolidation occurs (motor learning and skill retention)

### Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Running

**Performance Impacts:**
- Decreased running distance, time to exhaustion, and sprint times
- Reduced muscle glycogen concentration
- Elevated heart rate, ventilation, respiratory frequency, and lactate accumulation at submaximal intensities
- Earlier onset of fatigue and reductions in VO2max
- Moderate negative impact on endurance performance (2025 meta-analysis of 45 studies)

**Physiological Disruption:**
- Elevated cortisol levels
- Reduced testosterone and growth hormone
- Upregulation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways
- Impaired immune function

**Perceived Exertion:**
- Sleep deprivation distorts the body's perception of fatigue
- Heightened subjective fatigue during exercises of comparable intensity
- Particularly pronounced during high-intensity efforts
- Affects not only physical capacity but also mental perception of effort

**Injury Risk:**
- Sleeping less than 6-7 hours roughly doubles injury rates
- Each additional hour of sleep is associated with a 43% drop in next-day injury risk (NCAA Division I basketball data)
- Athletes sleeping 6-9 hours show significantly reduced injury incidence compared to those sleeping less

### Sleep Recommendations for Endurance Athletes

**Duration:**
- Minimum: 7 hours per night
- Optimal: 8-9 hours per night
- Elite athletes may benefit from 9-10 hours including naps
- If habitually getting approximately 7 hours, try to increase by up to 2 hours

**Sleep Extension (Banking Sleep):**
- Deliberately increasing sleep duration before anticipated sleep disruption
- Improves sprint times, reaction times, mood, and endurance capacity
- Should be employed in the week before major competitions or travel

**Sleep Hygiene for Runners:**
- Consistent sleep/wake schedule (even on weekends)
- Cool room temperature (18-20 degrees C / 65-68 degrees F)
- Dark environment (blackout curtains, no screens 30-60 minutes before bed)
- Avoid caffeine after early afternoon (individual half-life varies, typically 5-6 hours)
- Avoid heavy meals within 2-3 hours of bedtime
- Evening training can disrupt sleep onset; allow at least 2-3 hours between hard training and bedtime
- Red-light treatment at night may improve sleep quality and endurance performance (14-day study showed improvement on Cooper 12-minute run test)

**Sport-Specific Sleep Disruptors to Manage:**
- Early morning training sessions
- Evening competitions
- Transmeridian travel / jet lag
- Pre-competition cognitive arousal / anxiety
- High training loads (elevated cortisol can delay sleep onset)

### Napping Strategies

**Recommended Duration:**
- **20-30 minute "power nap"**: Effective for quick performance boosts with minimal sleep inertia risk. Improves isometric leg strength, mean power output, and anaerobic sprint performance
- **90-minute nap**: Allows a complete sleep cycle including slow-wave sleep and REM. Greater magnitude improvements in power output and recovery. Higher risk of sleep inertia upon waking
- **Avoid 40-60 minute naps**: This duration produces the worst sleep inertia (waking from deep sleep without completing a full cycle)

**Optimal Timing:**
- Between 13:00 and 16:00 (1:00 PM to 4:00 PM), with 14:00 (2:00 PM) being optimal
- Aligns with the natural post-lunch circadian dip
- Napping after 16:00 may interfere with nighttime sleep onset

**Managing Sleep Inertia:**
- Allow at least 30 minutes after waking from a nap before training or competition
- Sleep inertia can impair alertness and cognitive performance for up to 2 hours in some cases
- Caffeine (100-200 mg) consumed immediately before a short nap can help counteract inertia upon waking ("nappuccino" strategy)

**When Napping Is Most Valuable:**
- After partial sleep deprivation the previous night
- During heavy training blocks
- On competition days (especially afternoon/evening events)
- During travel across time zones

## 3. Supercompensation & The Fitness-Fatigue Model

### Supercompensation Theory

The classical supercompensation model describes adaptation in four phases:

1. **Training Stimulus (Loading)**: Application of training stress causes acute fatigue and temporary performance decline
2. **Recovery**: With adequate rest, energy stores and performance return to baseline (homeostasis)
3. **Supercompensation**: The adaptive rebound -- the body overshoots baseline, reaching a temporarily higher fitness level than pre-training
4. **Detraining/Decline**: Without a new training stimulus at the peak of supercompensation, fitness gradually returns to baseline

**Practical Implication:** The goal is to apply the next training stimulus at or near the peak of supercompensation. Too soon causes accumulated fatigue (overreaching); too late wastes the adaptation.

**Limitations:** This "single-factor" model is oversimplified. It treats fitness as one variable, when in reality multiple systems (cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neurological, metabolic) recover at different rates. It also struggles to explain why athletes can perform well even during heavy training blocks.

### Banister's Fitness-Fatigue Model (Dual Factor Theory)

Proposed by Banister et al. in 1976, refined throughout the 1980s-90s, this model addresses the limitations of simple supercompensation.

**Core Concept:**
- Every training session produces TWO simultaneous responses:
  - A **fitness effect** (positive): slow to develop, slow to decay (long time constant)
  - A **fatigue effect** (negative): fast to develop, fast to decay (short time constant), but of greater initial magnitude
- **Performance = Fitness - Fatigue**
- Because fatigue decays faster than fitness, there comes a point where fatigue no longer masks the fitness gained

**Mathematical Parameters (Banister's Original):**
- Fitness gain constant (k1) = 1.0
- Fatigue gain constant (k2) = 1.8-2.0 (fatigue effect is initially larger)
- Fitness decay time constant (r1 / tau1) = 42-50 days (CTL - Chronic Training Load)
- Fatigue decay time constant (r2 / tau2) = 7-11 days (ATL - Acute Training Load)
- Typical starting points: ATL = 7-day time constant, CTL = 42-day time constant

**Why This Matters for Coaching:**

1. **Explains tapering**: During a taper, training volume is cut but intensity maintained. Fitness (slow-decay) is largely preserved while fatigue (fast-decay) dissipates rapidly. The result is a net performance gain -- the "taper peak."

2. **Explains overreaching**: When training load is sustained at high levels, fatigue accumulates faster than it dissipates, masking underlying fitness gains. Performance declines despite fitness improvements.

3. **Explains detraining**: When training stops completely, fitness eventually decays (over weeks to months), but short breaks (1-2 weeks) cause minimal fitness loss while allowing significant fatigue dissipation.

### Practical Application: Hard/Easy Day Structuring

**The Principle:** Hard training days create both fitness and fatigue. Easy days allow fatigue to dissipate while fitness is retained. The alternation of hard and easy days optimizes the fitness-fatigue balance within each microcycle.

**Guidelines:**
- Never schedule more than 2 consecutive hard days (for most runners, limit to 2 quality sessions per week with at least 1-2 easy days between them)
- A typical week: 2-3 hard/quality sessions, 3-4 easy days, 0-1 rest days
- Hard day intensity should vary: one VO2max session, one threshold session, and the long run (if done at moderate intensity) create different stress profiles
- Easy days should be genuinely easy (Zone 1) -- not "moderate" -- to allow meaningful fatigue dissipation
- After a particularly hard session (race, intense intervals, very long run), 2 easy days may be needed before the next quality session

**Busso Refinement:** Thierry Busso modified Banister's model to account for how training monotony (doing the same load day after day) increases fatigue disproportionately. This supports the practice of varying daily training load rather than maintaining constant moderate load.

## 4. Zone 2 / Easy Running & Polarized Training

### What Is Zone 2?

Zone 2 is commonly defined as training at or below the first lactate threshold (LT1), also called the aerobic threshold (AeT) or first ventilatory threshold (VT1). This is the highest intensity at which blood lactate remains near resting levels (typically below 2 mmol/L).

**Heart Rate Guidelines (approximate):**
- 60-75% of maximum heart rate (varies significantly by individual)
- 85-89% of Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (Friel's system)
- LT1 can range anywhere from 45-70% of max HR depending on fitness level
- The only truly accurate method is lactate testing or VO2max testing to identify individual LT1

**Pace Guidelines:**
- Typically 1:00-2:00 per mile (0:37-1:15 per km) slower than threshold/tempo pace
- Should feel "easy" -- not moderate, not "comfortably hard," but genuinely easy

### Self-Assessment Methods (No Lab Required)

**Talk Test (Conversational Pace):**
- At Zone 2: you can speak full sentences in a back-and-forth conversation
- Breathing is noticeable but not labored
- If you can only speak in short phrases, you are above Zone 2
- If breathing feels identical to rest, you are in Zone 1 (still beneficial, just lower stimulus)
- The talk test works because the first ventilatory threshold closely corresponds to LT1

**Nose Breathing Test:**
- At Zone 2 or below: you should be able to breathe entirely through your nose
- When breathing through the nose becomes strained or you must open your mouth, you are approaching or exceeding LT1
- A practical and immediate biofeedback tool during runs

**MAF Method (Maffetone's Maximum Aerobic Function):**
- Formula: 180 - age = maximum aerobic heart rate
- Modifications: subtract 10 if recovering from major illness; subtract 5 if injured, regressing, or a beginner; add 5 if consistently training for 2+ years with improvement and no injuries
- Progress is measured by tracking pace at the same MAF heart rate over weeks/months ("MAF test")
- Aligns with Zone 2 philosophy but may produce a slightly different target HR than standard zone calculations
- Less peer-reviewed validation than the broader polarized training model

### Why 80/20 Polarized Training Works

**The Evidence:**
- A 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis (Oliveira et al., Sports Medicine) found that polarized training is superior to other training intensity distributions for improving VO2peak, particularly in shorter-duration interventions and highly trained athletes
- Optimal distribution: 70-80% low intensity (Zone 1-2), minimal time at moderate intensity (Zone 3), 18-26% high intensity (Zone 4-5)
- Elite distance runners naturally follow a distribution resembling polarization: approximately 76-86% in Zone 1, reduced Zone 2 (moderate), and augmented Zone 3 (high)

**Physiological Mechanisms:**
- High-volume low-intensity training drives mitochondrial biogenesis, increases lactate oxidation rate, and promotes Type I muscle fiber capillarization
- Minimizing time in the "moderate" zone (Zone 3 / "gray zone") reduces recovery demands and neural fatigue compared to threshold-heavy approaches
- The high-intensity component (20%) provides potent stimulus for PGC-1alpha activation and additional mitochondrial biogenesis
- Polarized training allows for longer, more effective total training volume under equal stress loads

**Why Easy Running Must Be Truly Easy:**
- Running in the "gray zone" (too hard for recovery, too easy for quality stimulus) creates the worst of both worlds: it adds fatigue without the specific adaptations of either easy or hard training
- Training too fast on easy days compromises recovery for the next quality session, reducing the quality of hard workouts
- The aerobic adaptations from Zone 2 training (mitochondrial density, capillary development, fat oxidation) occur at low intensities; going faster does not accelerate these adaptations
- Most recreational runners run their easy days too fast and their hard days too slow, resulting in a "moderate monotony" distribution that limits improvement

**Polarized vs. Pyramidal vs. Threshold Models:**
- Pyramidal (most volume in Zone 1, progressively less in Zone 2, least in Zone 3) is also effective; elite cyclists tend toward this distribution
- Both polarized and pyramidal significantly outperform threshold-dominant models for distance runners
- The key shared principle: the vast majority of training volume should be at low intensity

## 5. Deload Strategies

### What Is a Deload?

A deload (also called cutback week, down week, or recovery week) is a purposeful, planned reduction in training volume and/or intensity, typically lasting 5-7 days, designed to allow accumulated fatigue to dissipate while preserving fitness.

### When to Deload

**Planned (Proactive) Deloads:**
- Every 3rd or 4th week (most common: 3 weeks building, 1 week deload)
- Survey of competitive athletes: deloads were integrated every 5.6 +/- 2.3 weeks on average
- Athletes with injury history or lower training age may need deloads every 2-3 weeks
- Higher-volume training blocks may require more frequent deloads

**Reactive (Unplanned) Deloads -- Trigger Signs:**
- Easy runs feel disproportionately hard
- Elevated resting heart rate (3-5 bpm above baseline for 3+ consecutive days)
- Persistent HRV suppression (rMSSD below SWC for more than 5-7 days)
- Declining performance despite maintained or increased training
- Persistent muscle soreness that does not resolve with normal recovery
- Mood disturbances: irritability, loss of motivation, anxiety, depression
- Disrupted sleep despite adequate sleep hygiene
- Increased frequency of minor illnesses
- Loss of appetite or unexplained weight loss
- Subjective feeling of "I'm not ready to train" for several consecutive days

### How Much to Reduce

**Volume Reduction:**
- General recommendation: 20-40% reduction from the highest recent week
- For competitive endurance athletes, research (Bosquet et al. meta-analysis) suggests 41-60% volume reduction for 2 weeks may be optimal for performance enhancement
- For recreational runners, 20-30% reduction for 1 week is typically sufficient
- Newer or less experienced runners should use the higher end of reduction (30-40%)

**Intensity During Deload:**
- Maintain some intensity but at reduced volume (e.g., one short speed session instead of two full quality sessions)
- Alternatively, cut intensity entirely and run all easy -- appropriate when cumulative fatigue is very high
- Do NOT increase intensity to "compensate" for reduced volume
- Frequency (number of days running) can stay the same or decrease by 1-2 days

**Typical Deload Week Structure for a Runner:**
- Monday: Rest
- Tuesday: Easy run (30-40 min)
- Wednesday: Easy run with 4-6 strides (30 min)
- Thursday: Easy run (30 min)
- Friday: Rest or easy cross-train
- Saturday: Moderate-length easy run (60-70% of normal long run distance)
- Sunday: Easy run (30 min) or rest

### The Mechanism: Supercompensation Through Deloading

The purpose of deloading is not to enhance performance directly, but to:
- Mitigate physiological and psychological fatigue
- Promote recovery and facilitate physiological adaptation
- Enhance preparedness for the subsequent training cycle
- Restore glycogen levels
- Allow cortisol levels to drop, improving sleep quality
- Restore hormonal balance (testosterone:cortisol ratio)
- Provide mental/psychological refresh

### Active Recovery vs. Complete Rest During Deloads

- Complete rest (0 running) is rarely necessary and may be counterproductive unless injured
- Light activity (easy runs, walking, cycling, swimming) maintains blood flow and promotes recovery
- The key is genuinely reduced training stress, not zero activity
- Exception: if an athlete shows signs of non-functional overreaching (sustained performance decline over weeks), more aggressive rest (possibly 1-2 weeks of complete rest) may be warranted

## 6. Recovery Modalities: Evidence Assessment

### Cold Water Immersion (Ice Baths)

**Evidence Level: Moderate-Strong (with caveats)**

**What Works:**
- Effective for reducing delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and improving neuromuscular recovery (jump performance)
- Optimal protocol (2025 network meta-analysis): 10-15 minutes at 5-10 degrees C
- Combined CWI with other therapies (SMD = -0.68) outperforms CWI alone (SMD = -0.37) for DOMS reduction
- Most beneficial after competition, races, or during heavy overload microcycles

**What Does Not Work / Risks:**
- CWI immediately after resistance/strength training may blunt muscle hypertrophy and strength gains over 8-12 weeks
- Should be avoided after strength sessions if strength or muscle adaptation is a goal
- Routine daily use outside competition may blunt general training adaptations
- Sex differences: a 2025 RCT found neither cold nor hot water immersion accelerated recovery in women, suggesting benefits may not generalize equally across sexes

**Practical Recommendation for Runners:**
- Use strategically after races, very hard workouts, or during peak training weeks
- Avoid after strength training sessions
- Do not use as a daily routine during base-building phases
- Protocol: 10-15 min immersion at 10-15 degrees C (50-59 degrees F); temperatures below 5 degrees C provide no additional benefit and increase discomfort

### Compression Garments

**Evidence Level: Low-Moderate**

- Widely used by amateur and elite athletes
- Some evidence for reduced perceived soreness and improved blood flow
- Standardized dosing recommendations are still lacking
- May provide psychological benefit (feeling of "doing something" for recovery)
- No strong evidence for accelerated physiological recovery or performance improvement
- Unlikely to cause harm; reasonable as a complementary strategy

### Massage Therapy

**Evidence Level: Moderate for Soreness, Low for Performance**

- Limited efficacy for improving neuromuscular function (contraction time)
- More pronounced effects on muscle displacement and tissue compliance, particularly with deep tissue techniques
- Effective for reducing perceived muscle soreness
- Benefits may be partly psychological (relaxation, reduced stress)
- Practical role: useful for identifying and addressing areas of excessive tension or developing issues
- Most beneficial after hard training blocks or when specific muscle tightness is present

### Foam Rolling (Self-Myofascial Release)

**Evidence Level: Moderate-Strong for DOMS Reduction**

- Pre-exercise foam rolling has the greatest ability to mitigate the effects of DOMS
- Post-exercise foam rolling has the largest effect on reducing self-reported muscle soreness
- Increases blood flow and may facilitate metabolic waste clearance
- Practical, accessible, and low-cost
- Best used as part of both warm-up and cooldown routines
- 1-2 minutes per muscle group, focusing on areas of tension
- Does not appear to impair subsequent performance

### Active Recovery Runs

**Evidence Level: Mixed/Inconclusive**

**Arguments For:**
- Training in a pre-fatigued state may enhance aerobic adaptations (Copenhagen study found 90% greater endurance improvement in the leg trained twice every other day vs. once daily)
- Active recovery at 50% effort showed faster recovery than complete rest (ACE study)
- Maintains consistency, blood flow, and routine
- Psychological benefit of maintaining training habit

**Arguments Against:**
- Professor Guillaume Millet (exercise physiology researcher): "no scientific studies show the health benefits of a recovery run" -- some evidence suggests recovery runs slow recovery compared to complete rest after races
- Lactate is cleared by the body within 24 hours regardless of activity
- Only 3 studies (out of 165 in an umbrella review) investigated active recovery specifically
- Risk that "recovery runs" are done too fast, adding more fatigue

**Practical Recommendation:**
- If done, recovery runs must be genuinely easy (Zone 1, 50-75% of normal easy pace)
- For well-conditioned runners, an easy jog the day after a hard session is reasonable
- For newer runners, complete rest or walking/cross-training may be more appropriate
- Always prioritize sleep over getting up early for a recovery run
- Replace recovery runs with full rest when fatigue is excessive, soreness is not improving, or pain is present

### Stretching

**Evidence Level: Low-Moderate (Context-Dependent)**

**Dynamic Stretching (Pre-Run):**
- Produces approximately +1.3% performance improvement when done before exercise
- Preferred warm-up approach over static stretching
- Enhances musculoskeletal, neurological, and cardiovascular readiness
- Recommended as part of a comprehensive warm-up routine

**Static Stretching:**
- Short duration (60 seconds or less per muscle group): trivial performance impairment (approximately 1-2%) if performed within a full warm-up
- Long duration (more than 60 seconds per muscle group): substantial performance declines (4.0-7.5%) in strength and power
- May help reduce musculotendinous injury risk when included in a complete warm-up (preliminary evidence)
- Best used post-run for flexibility maintenance
- Does NOT reduce overall injury rates as a standalone intervention (moderate-to-strong evidence)

**Key Gaps:**
- Only 5 out of 300 trials in a major 2024 scoping review examined injury-related outcomes
- Very limited evidence on stretching effects specific to distance runners

### Summary Table: Recovery Modalities

| Modality | Evidence Strength | Best Use Case | Avoid When |
|----------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| Ice Baths (CWI) | Moderate-Strong | Post-race, peak training weeks | After strength training, during base building |
| Compression | Low-Moderate | During travel, post-race | N/A (low risk) |
| Massage | Moderate (soreness) | After hard blocks, specific tension | N/A (low risk) |
| Foam Rolling | Moderate-Strong | Pre/post-exercise routine | N/A (low risk) |
| Active Recovery Runs | Mixed | Day after hard session (fit runners) | When excessively fatigued, injured, sleep-deprived |
| Dynamic Stretching | Moderate | Pre-run warm-up | N/A |

## 7. Overtraining Detection: Integrated Warning System

### The Overreaching-Overtraining Continuum

| Stage | Performance Recovery | Duration | Intervention |
|-------|---------------------|----------|-------------|
| Functional Overreaching | Days | Short-term | Normal deload week |
| Non-Functional Overreaching | Weeks to months | Extended | 30-50% volume reduction for 1-2 weeks, easy only |
| Overtraining Syndrome | Months | Chronic | Complete/relative rest, medical evaluation |

### Multi-Metric Detection Framework

**Objective Markers:**
- Resting HR elevated 3-5 bpm above baseline for 3+ consecutive days
- rMSSD below individual SWC for 5+ consecutive days
- rMSSD CV increasing over several weeks
- Performance declining despite maintained/increased training load
- HR-running power index changes (can detect overreaching after approximately 6 days of overload)
- Nocturnal HR and HRV changes follow within 9-10 days

**Subjective Markers (often equally or more sensitive):**
- Persistent fatigue that does not resolve with a day off
- Loss of motivation to train for several consecutive days
- Mood disturbances: irritability, anxiety, depression
- Disrupted sleep despite good sleep hygiene
- Increased perceived exertion at normal training paces
- Loss of appetite
- Subjective "I'm not ready to train" feeling (diverges around day 11 of overload)

**A 2016 systematic review found that subjective measures (mood, perceived fatigue, wellness) are often more sensitive and consistent than heart rate data alone.** The strongest signal comes when subjective and objective markers align.

**Holistic Stress Awareness:**
- The body cannot distinguish between training stress, work stress, and life stress
- All stressors contribute to the total allostatic load
- During periods of high life stress, training load should be reduced even if training-specific metrics appear normal

## Implementation Notes for AI Coach

### Decision Tree: Daily Training Modification

```
1. Check morning HRV (Ln-rMSSD 7-day rolling average)
   |
   |-- ABOVE or WITHIN SWC:
   |   |-- Check subjective readiness (wellness score)
   |   |   |-- Good: Execute planned session
   |   |   |-- Poor: Reduce intensity by one zone, maintain duration
   |
   |-- BELOW SWC:
   |   |-- Check resting HR trend
   |   |   |-- Normal: Substitute easy run for planned quality session
   |   |   |-- Elevated 3+ days: Consider rest day or very easy 20-30 min
   |   |
   |   |-- Check sleep data
   |       |-- < 6 hours or poor quality: Rest day or easy 20 min max
   |       |-- 7+ hours, good quality: Easy run, no intensity
   |
2. If HRV suppressed for 5+ consecutive days:
   |-- Trigger unplanned deload week
   |-- Reduce volume 30-40%, intensity to easy only
   |-- Monitor for recovery (HRV returning to baseline)
   |
3. If performance declining + HRV suppressed + mood disturbance:
   |-- Flag potential non-functional overreaching
   |-- Aggressive recovery: 50% volume reduction, 1-2 weeks
   |-- Prioritize sleep, nutrition, stress management
```

### Key Thresholds for Automated Alerts

| Metric | Yellow Alert | Red Alert |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| rMSSD 7-day avg | Below SWC for 3 days | Below SWC for 5+ days |
| Resting HR | +3-4 bpm above baseline | +5 bpm for 3+ consecutive days |
| Sleep | < 7 hours for 2+ nights | < 6 hours for 3+ nights |
| Subjective readiness | "Below average" for 2 days | "Poor" for 3+ days |
| Performance | Pace > 5% slower at same HR | Pace > 10% slower at same HR |
| Weekly volume | > 110% of 4-week average | > 120% of 4-week average |
| ACWR | > 1.3 | > 1.5 |
