# Running Questions by Experience Level: Comprehensive Research Report

## BEGINNER (Couch-to-5K through First Half Marathon)

### Top 15 Most Common Questions

1. **"How do I start running if I'm totally out of shape?"** -- The most universal beginner question. Walk/run intervals (1-2 min run, 1-2 min walk) are the standard answer. C25K programs address this directly.

2. **"How fast should I run?"** -- Beginners almost always run too fast. The "conversational pace" test (able to speak full sentences) is the universal coaching answer. This maps to roughly 60-70% max HR.

3. **"Is it OK to take walk breaks?"** -- Walk breaks carry enormous stigma for beginners. Every expert source confirms walk breaks are not "cheating" and are strategically superior for building endurance.

4. **"How often should I run per week?"** -- 3 days/week is the standard beginner recommendation. Beginners worry about both running too little (not making progress) and too much (getting injured).

5. **"When does running get easier? / Will it always feel this hard?"** -- Running feels miserable for the first few weeks. Beginners need reassurance that adaptation takes 4-8 weeks of consistency.

6. **"What shoes do I need? Do I need expensive ones?"** -- The most common gear question. Advice converges on: go to a specialty running store, get gait analysis, expect to pay $90-130, and replace every 300-500 miles.

7. **"Am I a 'real' runner?"** -- Imposter syndrome is pervasive among beginners. They worry they are "too slow" to count. Every coaching resource emphasizes: "You become a runner the second you step out the door."

8. **"Should I eat before or after running?"** -- Nutrition confusion is rampant. Pre-run: 100-200 calories, 30-60 min before. Post-run: recovery food within 30-60 minutes. No gels needed for runs under 60 minutes.

9. **"What if I miss a training day?"** -- Beginners panic about missed days and try to "make up" sessions, which leads to overload and injury. The correct answer: skip it and resume as normal.

10. **"How do I breathe while running?"** -- Beginners often don't realize breathing technique matters. Nasal vs. mouth breathing, rhythmic breathing patterns, and "breathing through a stitch" are all common sub-questions.

11. **"What's proper running form? / Am I doing this right?"** -- Concerns about heel striking vs. midfoot, arm position, cadence. Common form mistakes: overstriding, slouching, clenched fists, arms swinging across body.

12. **"Should I stretch before or after?"** -- Widespread confusion. Current consensus: dynamic warm-up before, static stretching after. Many beginners skip both.

13. **"I have shin splints / knee pain -- is this normal?"** -- Shin splints are the single most common beginner injury. Often caused by doing too much too soon, wrong shoes, or weak supporting muscles.

14. **"How far should I run before my first 5K/10K/half marathon?"** -- Beginners want specific distance benchmarks. For a first half marathon: should be able to run 20-40 minutes comfortably, 4-5 days/week, before starting a training plan.

15. **"Should I run on a treadmill or outside?"** -- Both are valid. Treadmill is fine for C25K, but outdoor running is recommended before outdoor races to acclimate.

### What Data Beginners Care About

| Metric | Why They Care | How They Use It |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Distance** | "How far did I go?" -- the primary achievement metric | Tracking weekly mileage, celebrating milestones (first 5K, first 10K) |
| **Time/Duration** | "How long was I out there?" -- the C25K framework is time-based | Following walk/run interval programs |
| **Pace (min/mile or min/km)** | "Am I getting faster?" -- beginners obsess over this | Comparing run-to-run; often running too fast |
| **Calories burned** | Weight loss motivation drives many beginners | Often unreliable watch estimates, but psychologically motivating |
| **Weekly mileage** | Ensuring they follow the 10% rule | Preventing overuse injury |

Beginners do NOT care about (and would be confused by): HRV, training load scores, lactate threshold, VDOT, cadence details, ground contact time, vertical oscillation, or power metrics.

### Common Mistakes a Coaching AI Could Catch

1. **Running too fast on every run** -- If pace data shows every run at similar high effort, the AI can flag "you have no easy days."
2. **Mileage spikes** -- Increasing weekly mileage by more than 10-15% in a single week. Detectable from distance data.
3. **No rest days** -- Running 7 days/week as a beginner. Calendar pattern detection.
4. **Skipping walk breaks when program prescribes them** -- If pace data shows continuous running when a C25K day calls for walk/run intervals.
5. **Race-day mistakes: starting too fast** -- If first mile split is significantly faster than average training pace, flag it immediately.
6. **Running through pain/injury** -- If a runner logs significantly fewer miles suddenly, then tries to "catch up" the next week.
7. **No cross-training or strength work** -- Detectable from activity type data.
8. **Ignoring weather adjustments** -- Running the same pace on a 95F day as a 65F day.
9. **Pre-race gear/nutrition experimentation** -- New shoes or foods appearing on race week.
10. **No taper before race** -- Mileage not decreasing in the final 1-2 weeks before a goal race.

### Terminology Beginners Do NOT Understand

| Term | What It Means | Why It Confuses Beginners |
|------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Tempo run** | Sustained "comfortably hard" effort, ~80-85% max HR, usually 20-40 min | Sounds like "fast run" but is actually a specific physiological effort level |
| **Threshold (lactate threshold)** | The pace at which lactate accumulates faster than it can be cleared; ~1hr race pace | Requires understanding of exercise physiology that beginners lack |
| **Fartlek** | Swedish for "speed play" -- unstructured speed intervals during a run | The word itself is bizarre and memorable for wrong reasons; the concept of "unstructured structure" is paradoxical |
| **Negative split** | Running the second half of a race faster than the first | "Negative" sounds bad; counterintuitive that slowing down first leads to better results |
| **Positive split** | Running the first half faster than the second | Less confusing, but the terminology is still opaque |
| **Bonk / hitting the wall** | Glycogen depletion causing sudden, catastrophic fatigue | Sounds informal/silly but describes a serious and dangerous condition |
| **Taper** | Reducing training volume 1-3 weeks before a race to allow full recovery | Feels like "losing fitness"; psychologically terrifying for beginners |
| **Splits** | Time for each segment (usually mile) of a run or race | Easily confused with stretching splits |
| **Cadence** | Steps per minute (ideal ~170-180 SPM) | Metric seems arbitrary; beginners don't know what to do with this number |
| **Strides / striders** | Short (50-100m) accelerations at near-sprint pace with full recovery | Confused with "stride length"; sounds like sprinting |
| **Easy run / recovery run** | Very slow, conversational pace; 60-70% max HR | Beginners think ALL runs should feel hard to "count" |
| **Intervals** | Alternating hard/easy efforts with structured rest | Confused with fartlek; don't understand what distances/times to use |
| **PR / PB** | Personal Record / Personal Best | Acronym confusion; beginners don't know if they should pursue PRs |
| **DNF / DNS** | Did Not Finish / Did Not Start | Race-specific jargon |
| **BQ** | Boston Qualifier -- meeting the qualifying time for Boston Marathon | Only relevant to serious racers; beginners don't know the significance |
| **Chip time vs. gun time** | Time from crossing the start mat vs. the race gun firing | Confusing for first-time racers in large fields |
| **DOMS** | Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (24-48 hours after exercise) | The acronym is opaque |
| **RPE** | Rate of Perceived Exertion (0-10 scale) | Subjective metric concept is unfamiliar |
| **Shakeout run** | Easy jog before a race to loosen muscles | Sounds like a specific workout type |
| **The 10% rule** | Don't increase weekly mileage by more than 10% | Rule is simple but beginners don't know what base number to use |

## INTERMEDIATE (Sub-2hr Half Marathon, 40-60 km/week)

### Top 15 Most Common Questions

1. **"I've plateaued -- how do I get faster?"** -- The defining intermediate question. They have been running consistently for months/years and stopped improving. The answer usually involves adding workout variety (tempo, intervals, hills) rather than just "running more."

2. **"How do I use heart rate zones for training?"** -- Intermediate runners buy HR monitors and get immediately confused by zone discrepancies between devices, Zone 2 requiring walking, and the "grey zone" problem (running all workouts in Zone 3).

3. **"What is the right balance of easy runs vs. hard workouts?"** -- The 80/20 principle (80% easy, 20% hard) is the standard answer, but intermediate runners typically run too hard on easy days and too easy on hard days.

4. **"How should I structure my training week?"** -- The transition from "just running" to structured training with specific workout types: long run, tempo, intervals, easy runs, rest days.

5. **"How do I properly pace a half marathon / marathon?"** -- Moving from "just finish" to "race a time goal." Understanding negative splits, even pacing, and the danger of going out too fast.

6. **"When should I start speed work?"** -- Intermediate runners know they need to get faster but are unsure when and how to introduce intervals, tempo runs, and hill repeats.

7. **"How important is the long run and how long should it be?"** -- Minimum long run recommendations: 7 miles for 5K, 10 miles for 10K, 15 miles for half marathon. Many intermediates underestimate the importance.

8. **"Should I train by heart rate, pace, or perceived effort?"** -- The debate between objective and subjective measures. Current consensus: use all three, but perceived effort is the most reliable day-to-day guide.

9. **"Do I need to add strength training to improve?"** -- Almost universally yes. Two 30-45 minute sessions per week focusing on glutes, hips, core, and hamstrings. This is the single most commonly neglected area for intermediate runners.

10. **"How do I fuel for runs over 90 minutes?"** -- The transition from "no fueling needed" to needing to practice carb intake during long runs. Testing gels, chews, and liquids. The stomach needs training just like muscles.

11. **"How do I train for hills?"** -- Hill-specific workouts: hill repeats (5-10 x 30-60 seconds), hill sprints, incorporating hills into long runs. Different from just "running hilly routes."

12. **"What's the difference between tempo, threshold, and interval runs?"** -- Tempo (~10K effort, sustained), threshold (~1hr race pace, shorter), intervals (faster than threshold with rest). These are distinct workout types with different physiological adaptations.

13. **"How do I recover properly between hard sessions?"** -- Understanding that recovery runs should be truly easy, sleep is when adaptation happens, and deload weeks are necessary every 3-4 weeks.

14. **"Should I double (run twice in one day)?"** -- At 50-60 km/week, some runners benefit from splitting mileage into morning/evening sessions rather than one longer run.

15. **"How do I pick a training plan? (Pfitzinger vs. Daniels vs. Hanson vs. Higdon)"** -- Intermediate runners are ready for structured plans but overwhelmed by options. Each plan has different philosophies and weekly structures.

### What Data Intermediate Runners Care About

| Metric | Why They Care | How They Use It |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Heart rate zones** | Training by effort rather than just pace | Ensuring easy days are truly easy; targeting correct zones in workouts |
| **Pace per workout type** | Different paces for easy, tempo, interval, long run | Following structured training plans with prescribed paces |
| **Weekly mileage + distribution** | Not just total volume but how it's spread across days | Periodization: build weeks vs. deload weeks |
| **Splits (per mile/km)** | Pacing consistency within workouts and races | Even-splitting tempo runs; negative-splitting races |
| **Elevation gain** | Hill training quantification | Ensuring training matches race course profile |
| **Cadence** | Running efficiency | Targeting 170-180 SPM as a form cue |
| **Race time predictions** | From calculators (McMillan, Daniels VDOT) | Setting realistic goal times and training paces |
| **Resting heart rate (trend)** | Fitness improvement indicator | Lower resting HR over weeks/months = improving aerobic fitness |

### Common Mistakes and Plateau Issues

1. **Running all workouts at the same moderate effort** -- The "grey zone" problem. Easy runs aren't easy enough, hard runs aren't hard enough. An AI can detect this from HR or pace data showing narrow effort range across all runs.
2. **Not enough weekly volume** -- Trying to improve 10K time on 30 km/week when 50+ km is needed for continued adaptation.
3. **Skipping deload weeks** -- Every 3-4 weeks, mileage should drop 20-30%. Many intermediates just keep adding.
4. **Same routes, same workouts, month after month** -- The body adapts to repetitive stimuli. Need to vary terrain, distances, and workout types.
5. **Neglecting strength work** -- The most common oversight. Leads to injuries and plateaus.
6. **Poor sleep and recovery habits** -- Training hard but sleeping 5-6 hours. The adaptation happens during sleep, not during the run.
7. **Not racing enough (or racing too much)** -- Racing different distances provides stimulus and benchmarks. But racing every weekend prevents proper training.
8. **Fueling mistakes during long runs** -- Either not fueling at all (bonking at mile 15) or trying new nutrition on race day.
9. **Ignoring the taper** -- Adding last-minute "fitness" workouts in the final two weeks before a race.
10. **Comparing to others on Strava rather than tracking personal trends** -- Leading to demoralization or over-reaching.

## ADVANCED (Sub-3hr Marathon, 80+ km/week)

### Top 15 Most Common Questions

1. **"How do I periodize my training across a season?"** -- The central advanced question. Linear periodization (base > strength > speed > taper) vs. undulating periodization vs. block periodization. LetsRun debates rage about this endlessly. Lydiard-style single periodization vs. double-peaking per year.

2. **"How long can I hold a peak, and how do I time it for my goal race?"** -- Peaking is described as the result of overreaching + taper. Advanced runners worry about peaking too early or too late. General consensus: a sharp peak lasts 2-4 weeks; broader fitness can be maintained longer.

3. **"What should my ACWR (Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio) look like?"** -- The sweet spot is 0.8-1.3. Above 1.5 signals high injury risk. Advanced runners track this to balance progressive overload against injury prevention.

4. **"How do I use HRV to guide daily training decisions?"** -- Morning HRV measurement to determine if the body is recovered enough for a planned hard session, or if an easy day should be substituted. Research shows HRV-guided training produces better VO2max improvements than pre-set plans.

5. **"What's my optimal race pacing strategy for a sub-3 marathon?"** -- Even splits vs. negative splits. The physiology is clear: conservative starts preserve glycogen, reduce metabolic heat, and allow proper VO2 kinetics. But 92% of marathoners fail to achieve negative splits.

6. **"How do I raise my lactate threshold?"** -- Tempo runs, tempo intervals, and cruise intervals at or near threshold pace. The Daniels approach: train at VDOT-derived threshold pace for maximum benefit with minimum stress.

7. **"What role does VO2max play vs. running economy vs. lactate threshold?"** -- The three pillars of distance running performance. At the advanced level, running economy and threshold improvements matter more than raw VO2max gains.

8. **"How much mileage is optimal? When do I get diminishing returns?"** -- Sub-3 marathon typically requires 80-100 km/week consistently. The debate: some run 2:43-2:49 on 70-80 mpw and find that adding more doesn't help; others need 100+ km to break through.

9. **"Should I adopt the Norwegian (double-threshold) method?"** -- The trending training approach: two threshold sessions per week, lots of easy volume, minimal track work. Some runners report dramatic improvements (3:24 to 2:44), others find it doesn't suit them.

10. **"How do I manage training stress alongside life stress?"** -- HRV captures global stress, not just training stress. Advanced runners with demanding jobs and families need to account for total allostatic load.

11. **"What's the role of super shoes in my race strategy?"** -- Performance gains of 1-4% from carbon-plated shoes. Questions about: which shoe for which race, durability (when do they lose their "pop"), training in super shoes vs. saving them for race day.

12. **"How do I come back from an overtraining setback?"** -- Recognizing overtraining (HRV drop of 10-25%, elevated resting HR, persistent fatigue, performance decline). Recovery can take weeks to months.

13. **"What predictor workouts tell me my marathon fitness?"** -- Half marathon time (sub-1:25 for sub-3 marathon), sub-40 min 10K, long runs with marathon-pace segments. These benchmark workouts validate training progression.

14. **"How do I optimize fueling for a sub-3 marathon?"** -- Carb loading protocols, in-race carb intake (60-90g/hour), practicing race nutrition in training, timing of gels relative to aid stations.

15. **"When should I race to test fitness vs. when should I just train through?"** -- Using tune-up races (5K, 10K) during marathon builds vs. dedicated time trials. Balancing the fitness stimulus of racing against the recovery cost.

### What Data Advanced Runners Care About

| Metric | Why They Care | How They Use It |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **HRV (daily morning measurement)** | Recovery status and readiness | Deciding whether to execute planned hard session or substitute easy day |
| **ACWR (Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio)** | Injury risk management | Keeping ratio between 0.8-1.3; flagging spikes above 1.5 |
| **Training load (TSS/TRIMP/CTL/ATL)** | Quantifying cumulative training stress | TrainingPeaks fitness/fatigue/form charts; periodization planning |
| **VDOT / race equivalency scores** | Current fitness level and appropriate training paces | Setting tempo, interval, and threshold paces; predicting race times |
| **Lactate threshold pace (and heart rate at threshold)** | The key performance limiter in distance events | Tracking whether threshold pace improves over training blocks |
| **Race splits (per km/mile)** | Pacing execution quality | Post-race analysis: even vs. positive split, fade rate in final 10K |
| **Resting HR trend** | Long-term aerobic fitness | Detecting overtraining (elevated RHR) or improving fitness (declining RHR) |
| **VO2max (estimated or lab-tested)** | Aerobic ceiling | Tracking whether the ceiling is rising or if the focus should shift to economy |
| **Running economy / power** | How efficiently they convert energy to speed | Stryd power meter data; efficiency factor (pace/HR ratio) |
| **Sleep quality + duration** | Recovery optimization | Correlation with next-day HRV and workout quality |
| **Weekly mileage + intensity distribution** | Ensuring 80/20 polarization | Preventing "grey zone" training; ensuring enough easy volume |
| **Weight / body composition** | Race weight optimization | Small changes in mass significantly affect marathon pace at this level |

### Optimization Questions Specific to Advanced Runners

- "What is the optimal ratio of Zone 2 to threshold work for marathon performance?"
- "Should I do my long run on tired legs (Friday workout + Saturday long run) or fresh?"
- "What is the minimum effective dose of speed work during a marathon build?"
- "How do I sequence workouts across a microcycle for maximum adaptation?"
- "Can I race a half marathon 4 weeks out from my goal marathon?"
- "What's my aerobic decoupling rate and what does it mean for marathon fitness?"
- "Is my easy pace truly easy enough? (Cardiac drift analysis)"
- "How do I adjust threshold pace at altitude?"
- "What's my critical speed and how do I train it?"
- "How do I periodize strength training alongside high running volume?"

## CROSS-LEVEL COMPARISON: What Changes as Runners Mature

### Mental Model Shift

| Aspect | Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced |
|--------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Primary question** | "Can I do this?" | "How do I get faster?" | "How do I optimize everything?" |
| **Relationship with data** | Motivational (distance, streaks) | Informational (HR zones, splits) | Analytical (HRV, ACWR, TSS) |
| **View of walking** | "Am I failing?" | "That's for beginners" | "Strategic recovery tool" |
| **View of easy runs** | "Feels too easy, must go harder" | "I know I should, but..." | "80% of my training, non-negotiable" |
| **View of rest days** | "Losing fitness" | "Necessary evil" | "Where adaptation happens" |
| **Biggest fear** | "I can't finish" | "I've stopped improving" | "I'm overtraining / getting injured" |
| **Metric obsession** | Pace (faster = better) | Heart rate zones | HRV, training load balance |
| **Coach interaction** | "Tell me what to do" | "Explain why this workout" | "Debate the methodology" |

### Data Complexity Progression

**Beginner**: Distance, time, pace, calories. Phone app (Strava, Nike Run Club) is sufficient. Possibly a basic GPS watch.

**Intermediate**: All of the above plus heart rate zones, cadence, elevation, splits, weekly mileage tracking, race prediction calculators (McMillan, VDOT). Garmin/COROS watch with HR monitor. Training plan from a book (Pfitzinger, Daniels, Higdon).

**Advanced**: All of the above plus HRV (daily morning), ACWR, training load metrics (TSS, CTL, ATL, form), running power (Stryd), sleep quality metrics, resting HR trend, lactate testing, aerobic decoupling analysis, critical speed estimation. TrainingPeaks or similar platform. Possibly lab testing. Possibly a coach.
