## Categorized List of Common Runner Questions from Reddit

### Category 1: Training Planning & Structure

**Q1. "How many days per week should I run?"**
Frequency: VERY HIGH. One of the most asked beginner questions. Appears in daily Q&A threads constantly. The answer varies from 3 days (beginner) to 5-6 days (experienced), with the consensus that 4-5 days is the sweet spot for most runners.

**Q2. "What pace should my easy runs be?"**
Frequency: EXTREMELY HIGH. Perhaps the single most repeated question on r/running. Runners constantly worry they are running too fast or too slow on easy days. Common answers reference the "talk test," 60-75% max HR, or 2-3 min/mile slower than 5K pace.

**Q3. "When should I start doing speedwork/intervals?"**
Frequency: HIGH. Beginners who have been running for a few months want to know when it is appropriate to introduce faster workouts. The consensus: after at least 3 months of consistent running or being able to run 30+ minutes nonstop. Start with strides and fartleks before structured intervals.

**Q4. "How often should I do speed work per week?"**
Frequency: HIGH. Common follow-up to Q3. Most coaches recommend 1 session/week for beginners, 2 for intermediate runners, rarely 3 even for elites. Speedwork should be 8-15% of total weekly mileage.

**Q5. "How do I safely increase my weekly mileage?"**
Frequency: VERY HIGH. The "10% rule" is endlessly debated. Many coaches argue it is too conservative for low-mileage runners and too aggressive for high-mileage runners. The ACWR (acute-to-chronic workload ratio) is increasingly cited as a better framework. Down weeks every 3-4 weeks are universally recommended.

**Q6. "What training plan should I use for my first marathon?"**
Frequency: VERY HIGH on r/firstmarathon and r/running. Hal Higdon Novice 1 (18 weeks) is the most commonly recommended plan. Runners also ask about Pfitzinger, Hanson, and Daniels plans. The key debate: 16 vs 18 vs 20+ week plans, and whether to peak at 18 or 20 miles for the long run.

**Q7. "How long should my long run be?"**
Frequency: HIGH. Tied to marathon training. The debate centers on whether to run 20+ miles in training, or cap at 16-18 miles and rely on cumulative fatigue from the training week.

**Q8. "Should I do cross-training or strength training? How often?"**
Frequency: HIGH. Consensus: 2-3 strength sessions per week focusing on core, hips, and legs. Cross-training (cycling, swimming, elliptical) can replace 1-2 easy runs. Strength training reduces injury risk by ~50%.

**Q9. "Is the Couch to 5K (C25K) program good? What comes after?"**
Frequency: HIGH among true beginners. C25K is universally endorsed on r/running. The follow-up question ("What do I do after C25K?") is equally common -- usually Bridge to 10K or simply building a consistent running habit.

**Q10. "What should a typical training week look like?"**
Frequency: HIGH. Runners want a template. Common answer: 1 long run, 1-2 quality sessions (tempo + intervals), 2-3 easy runs, 1-2 rest/cross-training days. The 80/20 rule (80% easy, 20% hard) is endlessly cited.

### Category 2: Performance & Progress

**Q11. "What is a good 5K/10K/half marathon/marathon time for my age/experience?"**
Frequency: EXTREMELY HIGH. Perhaps the most common "validation-seeking" question. The median 5K finish time is ~36 minutes. Sub-30 is a solid beginner goal. Sub-20 is achieved by less than 2% of all 5K finishers. Runners constantly compare themselves to averages.

**Q12. "Am I improving? How do I know if I'm getting faster?"**
Frequency: HIGH. Runners look for metrics beyond just pace: HR at a given pace trending down, being able to run longer at the same effort, faster race times at equivalent effort. Watch-based VO2max estimates are commonly referenced (but debated for accuracy).

**Q13. "Why am I getting slower / hitting a plateau?"**
Frequency: VERY HIGH. Common causes discussed: lack of training variety, no speed work, inadequate recovery, under-fueling, underlying health issues (low iron/ferritin, thyroid), lack of periodization, no strength training, seasonal weather effects, and life stress/burnout.

**Q14. "Is a sub-X goal realistic for me in Y timeframe?"**
Frequency: VERY HIGH. Examples: "Is a sub-40 10K possible in a year?", "Can I break 3 hours in the marathon?", "Can I go from 25-minute 5K to 20-minute 5K?" These goal-setting posts generate significant engagement.

**Q15. "I used to be faster -- why did I slow down and how do I get back?"**
Frequency: MODERATE-HIGH. Often posted by runners returning after a break, aging runners, or runners who gained weight. The community emphasizes that fitness returns faster than it was originally built, but patience is critical.

### Category 3: Race Prediction & Pacing

**Q16. "What marathon time can I expect based on my half marathon time?"**
Frequency: VERY HIGH. The "double your half and add 10 minutes" rule is the most cited. The Riegel formula and Jack Daniels VDOT calculator are recommended tools. Key caveat: these predictors are optimistic for first-time marathoners and runners with low weekly mileage.

**Q17. "How should I pace my first race (5K/10K/half/marathon)?"**
Frequency: VERY HIGH. The universal advice: start conservatively. For 10Ks, every second too fast in the first 3 miles costs ~10 seconds per mile at the end. Even splits or slight negative splits produce the best times for most runners.

**Q18. "Should I try to negative split my race?"**
Frequency: HIGH. Extensively debated. Research shows that even splits or slight positive splits actually produce the fastest times for most recreational runners. True negative splits are an advanced technique -- 92% of marathoners fail to achieve them.

**Q19. "How accurate are race time predictors/VDOT calculators?"**
Frequency: MODERATE-HIGH. The Riegel formula works well for distances up to the half marathon but systematically underestimates marathon times by 10+ minutes. The Vickers-Vertosick formula incorporates weekly mileage and is more accurate for marathons.

**Q20. "What's a good race to use for predicting my marathon time?"**
Frequency: MODERATE. Half marathons are the best predictor. Using a 5K to predict a marathon is unreliable. The key insight: the ratio of slowdown between a 10K and half marathon reveals how much you will slow in the marathon.

### Category 4: Recovery & Injury

**Q21. "When should I take a rest day vs. a recovery run?"**
Frequency: VERY HIGH. The distinction between complete rest and active recovery is constantly discussed. Injury-prone runners are advised to take full rest days. Others prefer easy recovery runs (2-3 min/mile slower than marathon pace) to increase blood flow.

**Q22. "Is this pain normal or should I be worried? (Shin splints, knee pain, plantar fasciitis)"**
Frequency: EXTREMELY HIGH. The most common injuries discussed are shin splints, runner's knee (patellofemoral pain), plantar fasciitis, IT band syndrome, and Achilles tendonitis. The standard advice: if pain changes your gait or persists beyond a run, see a professional.

**Q23. "How do I come back from an injury without re-injuring myself?"**
Frequency: VERY HIGH. The consensus: start at 50% of previous volume, increase by 10-15% per week, alternate run days with rest days, use the "hop test" before returning from shin-related injuries, and do not return until pain/swelling have significantly improved.

**Q24. "How do I prevent injuries? (Especially as a new runner)"**
Frequency: HIGH. Top answers: don't increase mileage too fast, get fitted for proper shoes, do strength training (especially glutes, hips, core, calves), warm up with dynamic stretches, run on varied surfaces, and take rest days seriously.

**Q25. "How much fitness do I lose during time off?"**
Frequency: HIGH. Runners are anxious about losing progress. The science: aerobic fitness declines measurably after ~2 weeks of inactivity, but years of base building means your body retains a "fitness memory" and comes back faster than starting from scratch.

### Category 5: Data & Metrics Interpretation

**Q26. "What should my heart rate be on easy runs? Why is it so high?"**
Frequency: EXTREMELY HIGH. Zone 2 training is perhaps the hottest topic in running right now. Common frustrations: "I can barely jog and my HR is in Zone 4," "Do I really have to walk to stay in Zone 2?" Common explanations: inaccurate optical HR monitors, incorrect max HR estimates, heat/humidity, caffeine, stress, cardiac drift, and poorly calibrated zones.

**Q27. "How accurate is my Garmin/watch VO2max estimate?"**
Frequency: VERY HIGH. Garmin claims 95% accuracy vs. lab testing, but real-world users find significant variability. Optical HR monitors cause errors, the 220-minus-age formula has +/-20 bpm error, and low-intensity training styles cause VO2max to appear to decline. Consensus: use it for trends over months, not as an absolute number.

**Q28. "What do training zones mean and which system should I use?"**
Frequency: HIGH. Runners are confused by different zone systems (Garmin 5-zone, Maffetone MAF, 80/20 Endurance, Jack Daniels 5-zone). The key zones most ask about: Zone 2 (easy/aerobic base), Threshold/Tempo (lactate threshold), and VO2max intervals.

**Q29. "Is my cadence too low? Should I aim for 180 steps per minute?"**
Frequency: MODERATE-HIGH. The "180 cadence" myth is regularly debated. Most studies show 170-180 is typical for trained runners, but cadence varies greatly by individual (height, leg length, pace). The real concern is overstriding (landing ahead of center of gravity), not cadence per se.

**Q30. "What does my VDOT score mean and how do I calculate training paces from it?"**
Frequency: MODERATE on r/AdvancedRunning, lower on r/running. VDOT is a pseudo-VO2max based on race performance. It maps to five training zones (Easy, Marathon, Threshold, Interval, Repetition). Recalculate every 4-8 weeks or after a race PR.

**Q31. "What is ACWR and should I track it?"**
Frequency: LOW-MODERATE but rising. The Acute-to-Chronic Workload Ratio is increasingly discussed. A ratio of 0.8-1.3 is associated with low injury risk; above 1.5 significantly increases injury risk. More advanced runners and coaches reference this metric.

### Category 6: Nutrition & Fueling

**Q32. "What should I eat before a long run or race?"**
Frequency: VERY HIGH. Standard advice: a carb-focused meal 2-3 hours before, or a small snack (banana, toast) 30-60 minutes before. Avoid high fiber, high fat, and unfamiliar foods. "Nothing new on race day" is the mantra.

**Q33. "When should I start fueling during a long run/race?"**
Frequency: VERY HIGH. Begin 30-45 minutes into runs over 60-75 minutes. Aim for 40-80g carbs per hour depending on body size and intensity. Most runners use gels (e.g., Gu) every 30-45 minutes. Practice during training, not on race day.

**Q34. "I'm running to lose weight -- should I eat before/after runs?"**
Frequency: HIGH. The debate around fasted running is common. Experts generally recommend eating to fuel performance and recovery even when targeting weight loss. Runners are warned not to "eat back" calories with high-calorie rewards. A 400-600 cal/day deficit is recommended.

**Q35. "Why am I gaining weight while training for a marathon?"**
Frequency: MODERATE-HIGH. Runners are surprised when marathon training leads to weight gain. Causes: increased appetite leading to overconsumption, water/glycogen retention from increased training, muscle gain, and the psychological trap of "I ran 15 miles, I can eat anything."

**Q36. "Should I carb-load before a race? How?"**
Frequency: HIGH. Carb-loading is standard for half marathons and marathons. The modern approach: increase carbs to 8-12g per kg of body weight in the 24-48 hours before the race. It is not about eating massive amounts of food, but shifting macronutrient ratios toward carbohydrates.

### Category 7: Gear, Environment & External Factors

**Q37. "Does heat/humidity affect my pace? How much should I adjust?"**
Frequency: VERY HIGH, especially in summer months. Heat is one of the most discussed environmental factors. Running in summer often makes paces 30-60+ seconds per mile slower at the same effort. The advice: run by effort (RPE or HR), not pace, in hot weather. "Your consistency will pay off when the weather cools in the fall."

**Q38. "Is treadmill running equivalent to outdoor running? Should I set it to 1% incline?"**
Frequency: VERY HIGH. The 1% incline rule was established in a 1996 study: it compensates for lack of air resistance, but only matters at paces faster than ~7:09/mile. At moderate paces, indoor and outdoor energy costs are similar. The bigger issue is heat buildup (no wind on a treadmill) and lack of pace variability.

**Q39. "How does altitude affect my running? How much should I slow down?"**
Frequency: MODERATE-HIGH, especially from runners traveling for races. Effects start around 3,000 ft above sea level. Expect ~4 seconds/mile slower per 1,000 ft above 3,000 ft. VO2max drops 12-16% on arrival at altitude, but actual performance impact is 6-8% due to reduced air resistance. Full acclimatization takes 2-4+ weeks.

**Q40. "What running shoes should I get?"**
Frequency: EXTREMELY HIGH. The most common gear question by far. Standard advice: go to a specialty running store for a fitting. The shoe subreddit r/RunningShoeGeeks is often recommended for detailed reviews. Carbon-plated "super shoes" and their durability are frequently debated on r/AdvancedRunning.

**Q41. "How do I stay motivated to run in cold/dark/rainy weather?"**
Frequency: VERY HIGH, seasonal. This peaks in fall/winter. Common strategies: layering (dress for 15-20 degrees warmer than outside temp), reflective gear, headlamp, signing up for a race to create accountability, running with a group, and the maxim "you never regret a run."

**Q42. "GPS watch vs. phone for tracking -- does it matter?"**
Frequency: MODERATE-HIGH. Watch GPS is generally more accurate for pace/distance than phone GPS. Budget-friendly options like the COROS Pace 3 are frequently recommended. The Garmin Forerunner series dominates the conversation.

### Bonus Questions (Frequently Asked but Not Fitting Neatly into One Category)

**Q43. "I just finished C25K -- what's next?"**
Frequency: HIGH. A classic transition question. Common answers: run consistently at 5K distance 3-4x/week for a month, then gradually build to 10K. Don't rush to add speed work.

**Q44. "How do I find my actual max heart rate? Is the 220-minus-age formula accurate?"**
Frequency: HIGH. The 220-age formula has a standard deviation of ~10 bpm, making it unreliable for individuals. Better alternatives: a hard 5K race with a chest strap, or a dedicated max HR field test. This single misunderstanding drives many of the heart rate zone frustration posts.

**Q45. "Can I run a marathon on minimal training?"**
Frequency: MODERATE. Usually posted by someone with a race 8-12 weeks away and very little base. The community is generally cautious: finishing is possible but injury risk is high and the experience will be miserable without adequate preparation.

**Q46. "How do I deal with side stitches?"**
Frequency: MODERATE-HIGH, especially among beginners. Common advice: exhale when the opposite foot strikes, avoid eating too close to running, improve core strength, slow down.

**Q47. "Should I run through mild soreness/discomfort?"**
Frequency: HIGH. The community distinguishes between DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness, which is normal) and sharp/localized pain (which warrants rest). Running with general post-workout soreness is usually fine; running with joint or tendon pain is not.

**Q48. "How important is sleep for running performance and recovery?"**
Frequency: MODERATE. Increasingly discussed. Sleep is called the "legal performance enhancer." Poor sleep raises HR, impairs recovery, increases injury risk, and worsens mood. Most coaches recommend 7-9 hours minimum during heavy training.

**Q49. "What's the difference between tempo, threshold, and interval paces?"**
Frequency: HIGH on r/AdvancedRunning. Many runners confuse these terms. Tempo = sustained effort at ~lactate threshold (~10K-half marathon effort). Threshold = comfortably hard, maintainable for ~60 minutes. Intervals = VO2max pace, typically 3-5 minute efforts at ~3K-5K race pace.

**Q50. "Post-race lack of motivation -- how do I deal with it?"**
Frequency: MODERATE-HIGH. The "post-marathon blues" are widely discussed. Common advice: take a planned recovery period, sign up for another goal race, try a different distance or trail running, and recognize that the emotional letdown is normal.
